NO PRESSURE Reiltz Explains Gator Decision President J. Wayne Reitz last night clarified his statements concerning his naming Drex Dobson acting Alligator editor Wednesday. Dr. Reitz said lie had no desire to avoid controversial issues. He feels there has not been a balanced presentation of student news in The Alligator this trimester. His decision, he said, was influenced in part by student leaders' claims that their organizations have been slighted in news coverage. When asked why his action was apparently so sudden, and only five issues of The Alligator remained to be published, Reitz said the situation was cumulative and reached a point where "action was required." "I just did not believe since the total situation had reached a crisis stage, there was reason in continuIng the editorial staff of the paper at that time," Reitz commented. "The incident involving the Blue Key tapping session last Friday night was only a part of a total pattern," Reitz said. Reitz denied the Blue Key incident was a catalyst for the action which resulted in his naming Dobson acting editor. "Combination of circumstances, including those presented by student leaders was responsible for my decisions Reitz said. "There was no one incident involved in my decision." Reitz said "absolutely no outside pressure was imposed by anyone" in his decision in naming Dobson and his call for opening the sum mer trimester elections for Alligator editor again. Ex-Editors Speak Out Former editors Benny Cason, Andy Moor and Yvette Cardozo attacked the new editorship of The Alligator yesterday, claiming inaccuracies and suppression of letters to the editor in their behalf. The three dismissed editors, who received statewidenewspaper attention yesterday also said they plan to appeal their removal. Miss Cardozo asked students to ''compare the fact that this is getting statewide coverage with what they are being fed in The Alligator." She criticized the fact that no letters to the editor were printed yesterday on the controversy, although she said she had "seen copies of about 20 letters to the editor in our favor. We're still waiting to see some of them in The Alligator," she said. Moor said the three former editors are going to see an attorney today to get advice appealing their dismissal. They continued to attack the procedure by which they were removed. Cason saying that he was "terribly disappointed in President J. Wayne Reitz as a person," and Miss Cardozo saying that "We can refute any one of those seven points on the petition -or we could, if we were given the chance before Reitz." "There is still the fact," said Miss Cardozo, "That that so-call(See Ex-editors, Page 12) By EUNICE TALL Alligator Staff Writer The campus has been awaiting the arrival of Bob lope for the past few weeks but Maj. Alton Hardy of Air Force HMTC says he doesn't know exactly when the famed performer will be in Gainesville. The well-publicized perforroance will begin in Florida Gym at 8:15 p.m. Saturday where more than 8,000 persons will witness the show sponsored by the Arnold Air Society. Maj. Hardy indicated that students are welcome to greet Hope when he arrives at the Gainesville Airport sometimen' Saturday. As a result of the performance an estimated $4,000 in profits will be presented to the Dollars for Scholars program at the UF which enables students to attend school on national defense loans. Hope will arrive in Gainesville following a similar performance tonight in Raleigh, N. C., at North Carolina State. A long-time supporter of the Air Force and its ROTC programs, Hope has been honorary president of the Arnold Air Society (AAS) national organization for several years. Last year the UF organization prepared a bid to obtain Hope for this performance. Because Hope was available for only one show and because of intense public interest, seating has been arranged to accommodate the audience in FloridaGym. The stage will be located In the center of the gym floor with seating arranged completely around it. The center stage will place everyone close enough for good viewing of the entertainment. No reserved seats were sold, but each ticket is marked for designated sections within the gym. Seating within that area is on a "first come, first served" basis. Doors will open at 7:15 p.m. Holders of all $4 and $3 tickets are asked to use the entrance on the east side of the gym while all $2 ticket holders will enter through the main doors at the front of the gym. Several supporting acts will accompany Hope. Peggy Womack will bring an entirely new concept of dancing to the local audience. Singer Iris Faith will entertain with her own interpretations of a variety of popular songs. J. Fred Muggs, the "Champ Chimp" of NBC's "Today" show fame, will provide 15 minutes of entertainment. The twelve-piece Joe Pace Band of Daytona Beach will provide music for all the acts. BOB HOPE .AND FELLOW TROOPER Special Day Of Fools Practical jokers, today is your day-April Fool's. This is the day for playing jokes on friends. Typical is sending a friend on a fool's errand. The origins of the practices of the day are obscure. The occasion is observed almost universally throughout Christiandom. Generally the custom is traced back to the old custom in France (16th centuary) of paying formal calls on April 1, one week after New Year's Day, according to the Juliani calendar. When the old calendar was replaced by the Gregorian in 1562 mock calls continued to be paid on April 1 as a joke. Widespread observance of April Fool's Day began in England in the 18th century. In Scotland, the making of April fools is called hunting the gowk (cuckoo). The person made a fool of in France is called the "April tish." In Mexico the day is celebrated December 28 and is cheifly noted for the custom that objects borrowed on this day do not have to be returned. From ancient times India has had its spring festival of Huli, ending April 1, in which tricks and pranks play a large part. Premier Performance Of Oratorio The premiere performance of UF Humanities Professor Didier Graeffe's oratorio, Moses in the Desert, will be conducted Sunday at 4 p.m. in University Auditorium. The performance is a major undertaking on several counts, according to Reid Poole, Department of Music chairman. The composition is more than an hour in length and cast in three acts, Poole said. It includes 95 separate musical numbers. Dr. Graeffe has not only composed the music but has also written the text. The setting emphn.ized the dramatic impact of the text rat.-r than the lyrical or traditional choral values, according to Poole. The work is characterized by dramatic recitative and emphasis on motoric (See Graeffe .Page 12) HARRY GOLDEN Journalist Speaks Out Harry Golden, national synaicated columnist and Carolina Israelite editor, will speak here tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. in University Auditorium.

Wilson, Labor Win Majority LONDON (UII) -PriMe Minister Harold Wilson's Labor party surged into a powerful and apparently unbeatable lead in the British general election Thursday night. As swelling returns showed a strong popular voting swing in favor of Labor, the British Broadcasting Corporation said Labor had won. The Conservatives can not conceivably win now," BBV said. A popular vote swing appeared to be developing in favor of Labor that could give it a majority of 120 to 130 parliamentary seats. 'The British Press Association's computer predicted Labor would win an overall margin of 157 parliamentary seats.

Page 4, The Florida Alligator, Friday, April 1, 1966 aptitude M uch noted commentators and critics a Jacques 11 Barzun, Clark Kern and Paul Goodman have made frequent attempts to isolate and analyze various conditions and trends in American higher education. They speak of publish or perish, academic freedom, teaching machines, "free universities," and "multiversities." But they, and hosts of others, have virtually ignored a force which is subtly, yet radically, altering the course of American Colleges, high schools, and students. This is the Educational Testing Service. Headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, the ETS silently molds opinions and futures, determines policies and programs to a frightening degree. Promulgator of such multifarious products as SAT's, GRE's, Law Boards, Medical School Admission Tests, National Teacher's Exams, and IBM-knows what else, ETh holds in its multiplechoiced hands an incredible and awesome ability to determine the educational future of millions of high school and college graduates.

Well anit goitd. Certainly some method of coinparing applicants from different areas is needed. And certainly no university wants to admit students who will not do well. But we seriously question the ability of ETS products to accomplish these tasks successfully. And the side effects of theheavy weight given the test scores by admission directors are both unfortunate and undesirable. The aptitude sections of both the College Boards and Graduate Records are blatantly misconceived and misnamed. The concept that any kind of multiple-choice test could provide an accurate indication of an individual's aptitude in any area strains the imagination. Several college seniors majoring in either mathematics or engineering have told us that the GRE math aptitude test covers not so much aptitude as it does trickery. CVbing the power and influence of ETS is vitally necessary if the individual is to retain any semblance of importance in American higher education. At best the tests prOtide a convenience for admissions directors. At worst they assumeea rmvstical, god-like authority over the aspirations of American students -capable in one three-hour session of enhancing or destroying the future of at individualat his chosen institution. -The Rice Thresher new faces within the last 4 hours, there has been sudden influx of bright, anxious faces lowit in inid out ofThe Allisatir offices. \tosuit thn are very etthusiastic, r tetEI1o oi nthi'ln the n to it)'help get the paper Out. nill test' .r0und next yea, r till Ole be 'finedaty wonders,' diippeirtiniften The Allicator leases puitlt(t Iti' exet Ietne t-iir cv to be seci assin it the past ie iha' haJ peo'l cOn' in it work, but it seetiied that mOst iithem jt iuttwldn't get interecte~d.

Everybody knows this. Everybody knows that nothing has been done about it. Whatever happens in the rest of the country to income or employment or education or training does not happen in Watts. IllIs a good guess that at least 15 per cent of the male inhabitants of Watts over the age of 16 are not at work and not in school.

They can form a distinct impression of the more vulgar and garish aspects of the Antrican Way of Life, and they know that even tese are denied them.

Michael Dod-son, vo Lhis repl-y E ditor. I want to reply to the many people who ta sked inn reasons for supporting removal of Bettit s c as Alligator Editor. This letter is meantt that purpose. Neither the "University Powv' rf S ture'' tie campus politicians, nor outside p s e influenced my opinion that Mr. Cason e i b removed. I feel that my opinion and decisi, as a member of the Board of Student Publicationi Efectoral Board was a matter of self detervii ation dictated by my own knowledge and reason. More specifically I based my decision an I 'iiion on the episode of Friday, March 25. Dri the course of that eventing Mr. Cason exit 5 his irresponsibility by sending Yvette Cardozo ito the private and secret Blue Key tapping session. Ar. Cason aid Andy Moor waited outside in Mr. car while Miss Cardozo proceeded to cause a isturbance by refusing to leave. The Ai'iator editorial staff then adjourned to the Schoonter h ocm where they were elaborating on what they consieref to be the noteworthy accomplishment r.I io Miss Cardozo aid Mr. Moor had such 'r t fiun a this "sport" that they then sent back for I try two other students one of whom wasn ilXffr photographer armed with a camera and flss filf Placing this episode in the abstract it seen like a silly reason to suspend the editor of tinwslaf and indeed it would have if it were not for tl relevent factors. Mr. Cason and I in5 itto discussed the rights and privileges of students Amotg these discussed was the right of piiuc. Privacy applies to groups as well as individuals. Mr. Cason was and is well aware that scicraf members of Florida Blue Key have beenI a ptent force for the recognition of the dignity of fi'iits as members of a community rather than is mere charges of alt omnipotent university. Yet, \lr. Cason saw absolutely nothing wrong in violatits iithe privacy of a group that deserved to have its private session respected. The opinion I formed earlier mellowed into fiiness when a staff writer for The Alligator iirote a story describing and criticizing the evetof March 25th and which story Mr. Cason refnued to run for reasons best knowntohimself. It is argiail excusable to err, but to err and refuse to apologize or make amends is to me an indication of immaturity and irresponsibieity, especially of a person in an office of expected dignity and integrity. The acts of Mr. Cason of March 25th and the manner in which they were done formed the basis of my opinion of his irresponsibility. I did not, and do not, agree with the other allegations stated in the petition for removal, I believe the editorial standards of The Alligator for this trimester have been acceptable and the paper generally of a provocative tone. My action was based on what, in my considered judgment, were defensible motives honestly arrived at. I have itt no way abandoned the liberal political orientation which I brought to my office as Chancellor, but neither will I allow political liberalism to turn into suffrance for irresponsible actions.

Friday, April 1, 1966, The Florida Alligator, Page 5 Editor: It was with deep regret that I read of the dismissal of Mr. Benny Cason as editor of The Florida Alligator, and the subsequent removal by Dr. Retiz of Mr. Andy Moor and Miss Yvette Cardozo. Certainly there are circumstances under which students should be dismissed from responsible campus positions, but the reasons given (at least points 1, 3, 4, 6, and7) for the dismissals sound like something out of a handbook for totalitarian dictators (" ...harrassment of State Governmental officials and friends of the University of Florida.' Is this a newspaper or a student activitsheet'. If the latter, at least he clear about it!) If an editor criticizes the power structure or "frien's" of the power it has always seemed to me that such criticism where actual malice could not be found should be protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, see for exampleNew York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 255 (1964). (Ah, but there I go "waving the Constitution around like a flag", forgive me, I forgot we were all a part of an academic community and annoying cases like Sullivan shouldn't be tossed obout in such a reckless manner.) I think that the dismissal of Mr. Cason and his staff, if for the reasons given in points 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7, at least indicates two things: 1. the administration will not tolerate student criticism of administrative policy or of political or non -political figures who have it within their power to rock the university's boat. (See for example, the letter to Dr. Reitz from G. W. Karelas in the March 30 edition of The Alligator.) This would seem to be true, at least where the student doing the criticizing is in a position of campus leadership. 2. That those members of the faculty and student body Improperly Sober KALAMAZOO, Mich. (UPI) -Paul Lipford, 42, told a jury Friday he should be acquitted of malicious destruction charges filed after he drove his truck through a meat plant wall. After all, he explained, he was drunk.

I I9U sF a n d_ w 11 -/ who advocate sitting down and reasoningtogether in order to secure orderly change fail to recognize that although some reforms come about in this manner, there are circumstances which no amount of sitting and talking will change, as the Board of Student Publications learned. I guess it's all a "matter of internal dynamics,' so why am I acting so surprised? Fletcher N. Baldwin, Jr. Associate Professor of Law squelch the infidels Editor: Andy Moor is sending out appeals on Gainesville radio station WDVH for students to write letters supporting the previous editors of The Alligator. Well, here is a student thoroughly agreeing with Ur. Reitz'decision to fire the editors. If anybody wants to understand my position, he has only to goback and read the Alligator issue of Feb. 3, 1966, and observe tth slanderous tune of a sports column by Andy Moor (with Benny Cason guilty of allowing its publication). It appears that Andy Moor's definition of "freedom of the press' is "freedom to publish whatever tHe (capital mine) wants.'* Best wishes to Drex Dobson for a mature and responsible student newspaper. Bruno lachia clairif ication Editor: The Board of International Activities would like to clarify some points mentioned in the Editorial of March 28th's Alligator. The BIA would like to give credit to Bill Chiara, who has been serving as Secretary of International Affairs this year, but would like to clarify that this post serves as a link of communications between the Board of International Activies and Student Government, and that the policies credited to Mr. Chiara originated and were planned by the BIA. To be more specific the International House has been the work of a group of people over a long period of time and no specific individual should be credited with the project except the student body president, Buddy Jacobs, who was the first to take action on the project. The next point that should be clarified is that the Spanish Conversation Group was set up by the BIA two years ago. The weekly international column in The Alligator was originated before the present Secretary of International Affairs took office. As for the BIA donating the $159 to WUS and Dollars for Scholars, the plan was orininated and voted on by the members of the Board of Inter national Activities and that was when the Secretary first heard of the proposal.

"They seemed very surprised to find out the reason that they were asked to talk -that we were going to be fired." Statewide coverage of the affair, Aid Cason, has" already had some effect and it's going to have a lot more." "'My aim in pressing an appeal is correcting injustice," he said.

The performing forces include the University Choir, Choral Union and the Symphony Orchestra directed by Edward Troupin. Soloists are Guy B.

Much credit is due to Edward Troupin for his preparation and creation of this first performance of the composition and to Dr. Elwood Keister, who prepared the chorus, Poole said.

However, come September, this writer knows the Gators will probable knock off somebody they have no business beating and in turn be upset by a two touchdown underdog. There will be that drive killing fumble or that muffed TD pass. However, the Gator fans will be there -they always come back for more. Maybe next year will be different. Maybe.

Page 16, The Florida Alligator, Friday, April 1, 1966 Gridiron Tilt Saturday's football scrimmage at UF will be the most important single workout of the spring, according to head coach Ray Graves. "We will play this one with Southeastern Conference officials and as close to actual fall game conditions as possible,' says Graves. "I think this scrimmage will have a very definite bearing on just who lines up where on opening day next fall." Kickoff time has been moved up to 2 p.m., the hour the Gators will kick off their 1966 season next Sept. 17 against Northwestern in Gainesville. This scrimmage will be played for the benefit of "Dollars for Scholars" with adults admitted for $1.00 and children for 50 cents. Students with ID cards will be admitted free.

The $1,200 was tacked on to break a tie if someone else decided to ao as hiph as $1 25 million. For Charity tickets and receive all the profits," says Graves. Kay Stephenson will quarterback the Orange team and sophomore Larry Rentz the Blue. Inthe OrangeBlue game two weeks ago Stephenson hit on 18 of 25 passes for 251 yards and guided his team from behind to a 33 -28 victory. Winning TD came on a pass to sophomore Larry Smith with 21 seconds remaining. Rentz, one of the most electrifying runners to hit the Gator campus in many years, gained over 250 yards of total offense in leading the Blue team in that game. Blue hopes were bolstered by the return of linebacker Jack Card, who missed the first game. He has had the finest spring of his career at Florida and is a first string linebacker at this stage.
