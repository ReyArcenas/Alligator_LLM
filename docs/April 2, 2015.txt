We Inform. You Decide.www.alligator.orgNot officially associated with the University of Florida Published by Campus Communications, Inc. of Gainesville, Florida VOLUME 109 ISSUE 130 THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 2015THE RIDES WILL BE OFFERED WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHTS. By Carla ViannaAlligator Staff Writer cvianna@alligator.orgUF Student Government has partnered with Uber to offer a student discount for rides on and near campus. Throughout April, students commut50 percent off their rides Wednesday through Saturday from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. The promotion covers a large portion of the area surrounding campus, including Midtown. To use the UF Safe Ride program, new and existing Uber members should visit the blog.uber.com/ UFsaferides site for a promotional code. With that code, a separate “UF Safe Rides” option will appear on the app. Students must request the ride from this option in order for the discount to be applied. UF Student Body President Cory Yeffet said a normal Uber ride within the program’s boundaries costs an average of $5 to $7. “I can understand students saying that’s a little pricey, and maybe ‘I’ll walk this time,’” Yeffet said. Now, that fare will be split in half. “It’s a how-can-you-not kind of thing,” Yeffet said. “The goal is student safety.” SG’s current contract with the company ends in April, but Uber spokesman Bill Gibbons said they plan on maintaining the partnership. “The basis of our platform is trying to increase the options that people have for safe, reliable and affordable transportation,” Gibbons said.

There were 900 students enrolled in the Spring 2015 term — 300 fewer than initially predicted in a business plan drafted in 2013. Of those students, 91 percent are instate, said UF Online interim-director Andy McCollough. McCollough said he expects the program to grow despite current low numbers. He said the challenge is increasing out-ofstate enrollment, and a marketing team is working to advertise the program to out-ofstate and international students. UF Online was created to provide Florida residents with affordable and convenient access to higher education. Once UF Online was approved by legislation, it had about six months to launch before the Jan. 1, 2014, deadline. Enrollment has slowly increased since SEE ONLINE, PAGE 4 CAMPUSAlligator Staff

4 ALLIGATOR THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 2015UF HILLEL IS EXPECTING A HIGH TURNOUT DESPITE FRIDAY START. By Caitlin OstroffAlligator Contributing WriterJewish students will have plenty of options for Passover meals and free seders this year through the Lubavitch Chabad Jewish Center and UF Hillel. Passover is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. This year, it will take place from sunset Friday to sunset on April 11. During Passover, Jews refrain from eating “chametz,” which includes wheat, barley, oats, spelt and rye. Some Jews also refrain from eating “kitniyot,” which includes rice, corn, soy, millet, beans and peas. Hillel will be hosting a Seder on Friday evening in addition to holding its weekly services. Hillel is expecting a tremendous turnout even though many students may be going home, said Rabbi Adam Grossman, the CEO of UF Hillel. More than 150 people have signed up for the Seder, but many more are expected to attend. “It will be about $25,000 to do everything we’re trying to do this Passover season,” Grossman said. Chabad is also preparing for a higher Passover turnout and the price that comes with it. Chabad needs to raise $60,000 for Passover, said Rabbi Berl Goldman, a director of Chabad. So far, the center has raised about $40,000. There are currently 500 RSVPs for the Seder on Friday, but there will probably be more, Goldman said. Last year about 700 people came, many of whom made last minute reservations. Goldman is preparing 2,000 PassGoldman has ordered 250 pounds of brisket, he said. Chabad is also offering Passover meals for lunch and dinner throughout the holiday for students and community members. Lunch is $8 for students and $12 for the community. Dinner is $10 for students and $15 for the community. “We want them to concentrate on their studies, and we have everything ready for them,” Goldman said. Goldman said he hopes all Jewish people who are not going home will attend either a Chabad or Hillel Seder. “All Jews are family, all Jews are equal — labels are for suits,” Goldman said.

There were about 560 students in Spring, 475 during Summer and 838 in Fall. The program offers 15 bachelor’s degrees fully online, and 2018. In-state UF Online students pay about $111.92 per credit hour, which is no more than 75 percent of traditional residential students’ tuition. Out-of-state online students’ cost per credit hour depends on their degree’s national average market price. Traditional, in-state students paid $210.43 per credit hour during the 20142015 academic year, and traditional out-ofstate students paid $953 per credit hour. The university is eager to work with Cummings on the enrollment challenges. Cummings starts July 1 with a salary of $185,000. She is currently a director with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. UF spokesman Steve Orlando wrote in an email that she showed skills desirable for the position. “The search committee and the provost were looking for someone with the ability to plan strategically and to manage a large and complex operation,” he said. McCollough was part of the search for a new director, which began July 2014. He said he was impressed with Cummings’ experience and management skills. cant experience in terms of managing and strategizing,” he said. “I think she will be a quick learner.”ONLINE, from pg 1Raising enrollment a top priority for new director Cummings“All Jews are family, all Jews are equal — labels are for suits.”Berl Goldmanrabbi, Chabad Jewish Center

Well, yes, it’s been here for a while already — but now, it’s partnered up with UF’s Student Government as part of a Safe Ride initiative this April. Here’s the deal: Uber will give a 50 percent discount on rides to registered UF students, with some stipulations. The discount is only available on Wednesdays through Saturdays bordered by Northwest Eighth Avenue to the north, Archer Road to the south and Southwest 34th Street to the west. Bits of it also go all the way downtown to Main Street and to the area around Oxford Terrace apartments. Sadly, the ride has to begin and end within this zone in order for the discount to take effect. The Safe Ride program with Uber won’t directly affect existing free services like the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol and RTS’ Later Gator nighttime rides — UF isn’t handing the company a monopoly on rides. But, unlike SNAP and Later Gators, using Uber will cost you. Fifty percent, though — that’s a really big price reduction. College students, as you may have known, don’t exactly have a lot of cash to throw around. But, if you’re not among the students who live on campus or Sorority Row, it’s a comparatively cheap alternative that will get you where you need to be with hardly any walking. A couple dollars for a ride home is surely preferable to drunkenly stumbling there or attempting to wait at the right bus stop. The fact that the map includes the two main nightlife centers — Midtown and downtown — is a welcome addition, if not a surprise. But the major issue we see with the program is this: It cuts out after 34th Street and Archer, meaning the many students who live south and east of that border will be left out. The overall hope is that the partnership will improve student safety, adding another choice to the existing options of using SNAP, taking a bus, driving drunk or walking home. But wait, there’s a big “however” coming. However, Uber is often sketchy as all hell. Not to rain on anybody’s parade — after all, we think this is a great idea — but it’s prudent to remember some questionable aspects of the company we’d be doing business with. Uber has garnered itself a rather nasty reputation for using Scientology-esque tactics against its competitors and its critics. They’ve been caught sabotaging ride orders from rival companies in an attempt to undermine competition. They treat their drivers horribly, and once an Uber executive suggested the company investigate a journalist critical of the company, presumably to blackmail her. Sometimes, Uber drivers themselves commit crimes. There are a litany of cases where drivers assault passengers, including one where a driver returned to somebody’s house and attempted a robbery. On the whole, though, this will probably be good for us. Uber’s general sketchiness won’t affect us directly, and creeps exist everywhere — just be wary of suspicious behavior. Evangelical voters may decide fate of 2016 electionIn order to win an election, a campaign has to mobilize voters. The best way to mobilize voters is to go after galvanized and organized groups of constituents. Perhaps the most mobilized and galvanized group in evangelical voters. Though the number of Americans who consider themselves religious has been steadily decreasing for decades, evangelical voters still head to the polls in great numbers. And the numbers of evangelicals are growing. This is in no small part due to the newest members of the evangelical coalition: Hispanics. More and more Hispanics are shifting away from the more liberal Pope Francis-led Roman Catholic Church and into more conservative American megachurches. According to the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, percent of Hispanics in America now call themselves ‘born again.’” In addition to this, the Pew Research Center states that while “more than two-thirds of the 52 millionplus Latinos in the U.S. are Catholic, that number could be cut in half by 2030.” As the number of Hispanics in America continues to rise, so does the number of evangelicals. This Evangelicals are incredibly involved in politics. Remember who evangelicals favored in 2008: former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, the guy who won the Iowa caucus. In 2012, they supported former Sen. Rick Santorum, who placed second in the Republican primaries. Evangelicals can and do Now consider what the Republican hopefuls will have to face in 2016: the primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. These states have impressive numbers of evangelical Christians who vote. In 2012, 57 percent of Iowa Republican voters were evangelical. In South Carolina, 65 percent of Republicans were. to what NBC’s Chuck Todd calls the “SEC Primary.” These Southeastern states include Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia. Evangelicals make up at least 24 percent and at most 41 percent of these states’ populations. Now you can see why Ted Cruz went to the evangelical Liberty University to announce his candidacy. You can also see why the Grand Old Party contenders are supporting Indiana’s religious freedom bill. Evangelicals’ strong turnout rate, political involvement and growing numbers make the Christian right one of the most, if not the most, important constituencies in the Republican and General elections. This is worrying for the establishment GOP. Jeb Bush has raised more money than any other potential Republican candidate. However, dollar bills can’t vote. Mobilized citizens can. For the lesser-known establishment candidates who are falling behind the Bush money machine and have little evangelical support — say a Chris Christie or a Bobby Jindal — this development does not bode well. What I would like to know is what the evangelicals would like in return for their support. George W. Bush captured the evangelical vote in 2000 and 2004. He gave them two very religious, albeit Catholic, Supreme Court justices who favor the religious rights of corporations. In 2002, he designed “faith-based initiatives” to “federally fund faith-based programs.” What would the current evangelical movement, which feels more under siege from the liberal secularists than ever, want in exchange for their support? I can imagine they would want prayer in the classroom and the continuation of religious tax exemption. These are not necessarily bad things for the secular country, but these issues are important to the evangelical community. gelicals, one can claim the religious voters want to undo the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision and limit marriage to one man and one woman. In any event, evangelical voters could be kingmakers in the 2016 election. Because of their campaign, but also in the governing of the country thereafter. Michael Beato is a UF economics junior.

They will be in Florida for a whole week of shows in St. Augustine, Sarasota, St. Petersburg and more.

On Saturday, the Fort Lauderdale-based emcee will bring his high-energy beats to High Dive, 210 SW Second Ave. Doors open at 9 p.m. and the show will kick off at 10. Tickets can be purchased at the door for $13 or in advance for $10 at Hear Again Music and Movies, as well as on ticketweb.com. and fans can expect anything from old-school style rhymes to contemporary beats. “I could make somebody so emotional in one second and that you could have Miley Cyrus twerking to at the club,” HiRez said. Among the four openers is local rapper BG Blazel, who has performed at High Dive several times. You can expect Blazel, like Rez, to switch up from conscious songs to upbeat club tracks. Blazel describes Hi-Rez’s style as a down-to-earth and laid“If I could categorize it and imagine somebody, it would be Mac Miller,” he said. Since 2011, 21-year-old Hi-Rez has built a large fan-base on videos on YouTube. Fans have awaited his new music with the help of his social media campaign #BackSeatBars, where he freestyles in the backseats of cars. Now, Hi-Rez said he is excited about the release of his new mixtape. The rapper said he is more in tune with himself than he used to be, and this is the most effort he’s put into his music since he started. “I’ve been working on this music for the last two years of my life so, you know, that right there is saying it itself,” he said. Ever since he started making music in middle school, he said he knew he wanted to be around music his entire life. The old-school rappers he grew up on, such as Biggie, Nas, JayZ Among his lyrics, a line that he said sticks with him is “Even through the darkness, there is light.” The rapper touches on issues such as emotional disorders and world problems. Hi-Rez placed an importance on taking your work seriously. He said he knew there were other artists that were better than him, but they didn’t take themselves half as seriously as he did. “I took myself serious, which now looking back on it, was the most important thing in my life.”Rapper Hi-Rez to headline at High Dive for 1st time Friday MUSIC on the big screen.

TRACK AND FIELDBy Kyle BrutmanAlligator Writer @KBrut13 Usually, coach Mike Holloway and the No. 2 Florida men’s and their show on the road. The Gators have traveled near and far this season, venturing as far as Ames, Iowa, for the Iowa State Classic on Valentine’s Day weekend and as close as Orlando for the UCF Black and Gold Challenge and UCF Invitational — both taking place just 125 miles from UF’s campus. But this weekend, the Gators are staying home. ida will host a meet in Gainesville, where the Pepsi Florida Relays will take place at the Percy Beard Track. Parking near the O’Connell Center will be lifted for the event, and James G. Pressly Stadium is expectSenior Ciarra Brewer feels the luxury of racing on home turf gives the Gators a large advantage over “We’ve trained on this track, we know this track,” Brewer said. “It’s just a practice with more competition.” Brewer has been one of the main contributors to Florida’s success throughout both the indoor and outdoor seasons. She has placed in the top year and was crowned the women’s indoor triple jump champion at the NCAA Indoor Championships in March. While Brewer feels that the factors affected by the home meet put Florida in a favorable position, Holloway knows that the squad cannot rely on the possible home-meet advantages to perform well. “It’s always good to be at home in front of your home crowd and alumni and in front of friends and family,” Holloway said. “Other than that it’s just another track meet.” This weekend’s meet begins a month-long stretch in which the Gators will escape the traveling that consumes much of the team’s season. Florida will get a three-week competitive break leading up to this year’s Tom Jones Memorial Invitational in Gainesville on April 24, followed by the LSU Invitational in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.Gators preparing to compete on home track this weekendBrewer
