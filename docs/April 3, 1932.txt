If we want a literarymagazine, more intr*.murals, or other things let the taxes be specifically laid for these things It may be all right to spend taxes for these causes, but It is not just that the students should be told one thing about the expenditures and know that another thing i trite.

There was-there is-no gentler, stronger, manlier man." .THE FORUM The Florida Review appeared for the first time this year, seeking to fulfill a long-felt need for a literary magazine on the campus. There is very little at the University to encourage anything except vocational and technical interests. More is necessary, if a real Influence on state and national life is to be expected. There should be more encouragement for literature and the arts. There are various agencies struggling at the present time to meet these needs. Among them are, besides the Review, Speculative Society, the Poetry Society, and the Florida Players. AU of these organizations reach a comparatively small number and have a rather difficult time in meeting the purpose for which they were founded. Rollins College has achieved national prominence because of Its emphasis upon the literary activities of its students. There is no reason why Florida cannot do likewiseno reason why it should not do better. If the State, the University, the student body, the alumni, and the literary societies would contribute to a general fund for this purpose, It would be a worthy and a valuable gift, and would bring credit to those who supported it. The editors of the Florida Review take this means of making public their 4mggestion. They are sure that the literary sde of college life needs much more emphass than has been given to it, and they feel that there Is enough talent here at the University to make any such endowment pay for Itself many times over in added glories to the school and the state. They hope %hat thea I ministration, the student body, and the Alumni Association will consider ts matter carefully, and they will cOntmtme to sowthir tntereot in the progress O the Mwsty Ot Vlortlda. Udtorbcbet, By HARVEY HAESEKER Monday and Tue.day"Business a n d Pleasure"Will Rogers, and that mean% it Is good. Wednesday -"Are You LAstening" -Depicts backstage of radio world. Thursday and Friday '"isorderiy ('onduet"-Eilers Tracy and Brendel. Saturday-"Charle Chan's Chance"Another of the murder mysteries with Warner Oland. Will Rogers, America's great humorist Is back with another that should fill many columns with "stars." This time it Is "Business and Pleasure." Playing with Will In his latest are: Jetta oudal, Joel McCrea, Dorothy Peterson, Peggy Ross, Cvril Ring. Jed Proutv, and Boris Karloff. The story is based on the comedy "The Plutocrat" by Arthur Goodrich, which in turn was based upon the novel of the same name by Booth Tarkington. In "Business and Pleasure" Rogers is a rajah of laughter. He plays the part of a sharp-dealing blade from the States wrapped up in the razor business ...til he disovers the pleasure of raisingthatsit. In this one the corn-fed kidder of Claremore becomes a cut-up of Damascus ..insults a sultan and intrigues a siren! As an Arab. Will matches wits and wisecracks with shieks and sirens. That should be enough for we admit prejudice. Will Rogers has spiked the rumor that he is a product of Eton and Oxford after It began to appear that it was getting widesnread credence. He claims to have attended only two small American schools, both in Missouri. and one of them a military academy. Rogers credits Brisbane, editor and writer, with starting the report of his hiqler education. To ouote from the periodicals: "Arthur and I kid each other back and forth in our colunns." Will said recently. "He thought It would be a great joke to tell the folks that I. who never have been In a university except as a guest, was a 'product of one of the world's most famous universities. I thought it a good Joke. too. and helped it along by saving that a man oueht to be allowed to live down his past. Continuing. "I'll have to trot mt mv favorite gag on Arthur' He's the world's greatest booster for aviation, but he's never had a foot off h ground. You can't coAx him into a plane. That many s nersons took Brisbane's little Joke on Rogers seriouslv is indicated by the number of letters the comedian received. Many said they had known all the time that Rogers was an Englishman, and that the cowboy back"'ound he claimed was just publicity. V "Are You Listening" is somegthing on a rather new subject for the cinima world. Not that similar pictures haven't been produced. but rather this line is o,,p that hasn't been ad overdone. William Raines. Made Evans, Anita Page. Karen Morley, Nell Hamilton, Wallace Ford. Jean Hershold, Joan Marsh and John Millan comprise the large and well balance1 east. This one on the radio game should offer some interesting sidelights on the industry. Spencer Trace, best known for his farce in "Skv Devils," is playing this time with Sally Ellers in "1Tsorderly Conduct," Tracy plays the part of a cop In his usual proficient manner. In his seven productions for Fox he has been called upon to drivemany different "means of conveyances" In six of them. These "means" have includod a ten-ton truck, a tramp steamer. a large bombing plane. a large touring car, and a locomotive. This time it is a motorcycle. Of course he has doubled in manV of them and most of these jobs are in his line. The story has to do with the usual, or rather general, corrup. tion in any larre city. A powerful politician almost "busts" him for not falling In line, and then What doe' he do but arrest thel rower's daughter. You know the line anyway"Charlie Chan's Chance," playtug on Saturday, ?Ids Warner Gland as Charlie Chan the sleep. but master Chinese detective.
