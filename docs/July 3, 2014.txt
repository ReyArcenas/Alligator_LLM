THURSDAY, JULY 3, 2014 ALLIGATOR, 5 UF WILL DISCUSS LATER. REBECCA KRAVETZ Alligator Contributing WriterStudents looking to apply to law school may no longer need to take the LSAT starting in August. The American Bar Association recently said accredited law schools can admit 10 percent of an entering class without requiring the LSAT. The UF Levin College of Law Interim Dean George Dawson wrote in an email that the change will be considered when the faculty meets to evaluate its admissions. We will review data from prior years in order to assess the potential impact of such a change on our admissions policies and on our students, Dawson said. To be considered, a student must apply to a law program at the same institution as their undergraduate program or must be seeking a J.D. degree in combination with a degree of a different discipline, according to the ABA. A student must also have scored at or above the 85th percentile on the ACT or SAT. Students with the combination of degrees must have scored at or above the 85th percentile on the GRE or GMAT, must be ranked in the top 10 percent of their undergraduate class or have a cumulative GPA of a 3.5 or above throughout six semesters of academic work. These requirements should enwill be admitted even if they have not taken the LSAT, Dawson said. Incoming Levin College of Law student Elise Holtzman, 23, said because she spent so much time improving her LSAT score, a law school that does not require it would become less attractive to her. I dont know if the LSAT is necessarily the best method of measuring a persons ability to think logically, Holtzman said. But there has to be something. LSAT possibly waived for 10 percent of law school admitsSTATE ALDO ARAUJOAlligator Contributing WriterThey may not be playing in the FIFA World Cup, but the Special Olympics Uniat the 2014 Special Olympics USA Games. The Orlando Special Olympics soccer team took home the silver medal at the USA Games in New Jersey. Olivia Marincov, a 20-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiology junior, has been involved with Special Olympics since she was in the eighth grade, coaching soccer at a summer camp to children with autism and playing in this years Olympic games. one without an intellectual disability, for her team, which practices three times a week. Just like a regular soccer practice, we do conditioning and ball-control drills, Marincov said. Theyre just like us, but sometimes you just have to break things up and In June, the Orlando team played against Nebraska, and although they lost 2-0, Marincov said it felt like they won. She received a phone call on Tuesday from her coach that her team received a bid to go to the Special Olympics World Games in the future. Its a huge part of my life, and it means a lot to me, Marincov said. Ive seen the team grow up as players and as people. Danielle Spears, spokeswoman and public relations director for Special Olympics Florida, said the goal of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and competition for children and adults with intellectual disabilities by offering them a fair opportunity to demonstrate their skills and increase public awareness. There were 180 Florida athletes and coaches who attended the games this year, she said. In total, 3,500 athletes participated, and there were more than 70,000 volunteers and families present. She said that the success of this team is a win for inclusion and acceptance for people with intellectual disabilities. We really believe in the transformative power of sports, Spears said. By sharing their abilities and successes with the community, we hope to shatter stereotypes about people with disabilities.UF student helps US Special Olympics soccer team win second

10, ALLIGATOR THURSDAY, JULY 3, 2014 JOEY MARTINEZAvenue WriterMatt Sherman wants to show you what is on the menu  James Bonds menu. The 45-year-old Gainesville author and UF religion alumnus has created a website where people can donate money to publish a higher quality version of his book, Eating James Bond: 007s Every Last Meal. He has until July 15 to reach his $20,000 goal. That money will be used to cover the cost of color printing, have a professional photographer shoot meals and memorabilia and to advertise the book. The book will be published in black and white if the $20,000 goal is not achieved. The Bond novels became famous because of the sense of travel and the detailed descriptions of international cuisine, Sherman said. The agent has something to eat every 10 minutes during a Sherman said his book can serve as a tour guide to all the different locations that Bond has ever had a drink or eaten a meal. You can eat what Bond eats, where Bond eats, Sherman said. The cuisine plays a bigger part in the movies and books to a true fan, said Frank Herbert, 66, who has been studying James Bond novels and movies for 50 years and is a member of the International James Bond fan club based in the U.K. Average fans may only notice a few meals here and there. When I was younger everyone wanted to eat what James Bond ate, Herbert said. People were even interested in the type of toothpaste he used. Some things have changed since then, considering the opinion of Alan Ferry, a 27-year-old aerospace engineering junior. I dont enjoy martinis whether theyre shaken or stirred, Ferry said. I prefer beer. The book will be published through CreateSpace, Amazon.com Inc.s self-publishing platform, and it will be available on Amazon and other outlets, Sherman said. The book is scheduled to be published by Aug. 1. Books will cost approximately $25 for the black-and-white version and $35 for the color version. The site started accepting donations May 31, and at the time of print, the donation total was at $1,760.

Fireworks scare them, hot dogs upset them and bug spray makes them sick. Its no wonder that more pets are lost on the Fourth of July than on any other day of the year. The Humane Society is already premostly dogs that will run away due to alize how scary it is for animals, said Amanda Burks, executive director of the Alachua County Humane Society. Burks suggests bringing pets inside before the festivities get underway. She recommends leaving pets at home if you are going to a party. Any changes to an animals diet can add stress as well. Tossing your dog a burger can cause digestive issues. Common Fourth of July items like bug spray and citronella candles can make pets sick if ingested. Never leave alcoholic drinks unattended or within reach of animals, Burks said. Intoxicated with a bellydisplay is not how your pet wants to spend its evening. Setting up a safe space for your pet, such as a crate, is an essential precaution, Burks said. If your animal already has medication for storms or a Thundershirt  a shirt that uses gentle pressure to provide a calming effect on dogs  Burks recommends using those. Dogs arent as good at hiding, so as scared, but theyre better at hiding, so they run under the bed instead of jumping over the fence. The animals at the Humane Society will be kenneled earlier than normal on Friday. Being in their safe space keeps the agitation level low, Burks said. The best precaution is to make sure makes it easier to get animals back to their owners. Furry friends fear the 4th Sherman

12, ALLIGATOR THURSDAY, JULY 3, 2014 KELSI AND KERI MATWICKAvenue WritersRecipes are, on one hand, an instruction manual with directions or instructions on how to make something and also a narrative with engaging prose or a story that elevates the procedure into something else entirely. Like directions on how to assemble an ice cream maker or build a bookshelf, most recipes instruct an addressee in a coherent, clear layout, often with steps broken down into numbers or bulleted points in chronological order. Yet, recipes are different than other instruction manuals. Lets make a comparison. Compare the following instructions: (1) instructions on how to set up a network security key for your computer (from Windows) and (2) a recipe from a Duncan Hines cake mix. Recipes, like instruction manuals, typically use imperative or command tense such as bake or mix. These may be offset from the rest of the directions by font styling with all caps (like example 2), made bold, italicized or underlined. Also, like instruction manuals, there is an implicit subject and does not make direct reference to the reader. Indeed, from its Latin root recipere, recipe means take! We often do not want to wade to set up a wireless network or to bake a cake for that matter. However, we are more willing to invest effort and time reading a recipe than in other procedural discourse. Some admit to having a cookbook on their bedside table. Why? We put more in because we get more out, especially with recipes that have an explanatory, prosebased layout, as in (3) below. Good recipes go beyond the basic mechanics of cooking: they enable the reader/cook to know what to look for during and after the cooking process. Parenthetical explanations provide reasons or additional descriptions about the desired results, increasing our understanding of the cooking process. They build credibility in the recipe as an attempted and successful procedure. So, thanks to the recipe writers previous attempts, if we want runnier yolks, then we know to cook a minute less. We understand more the why than just the how. Other recipes have prose that conjures up scenes in the readers mind, such as I remember, when I was in the south of Italy, eating eggplant that had been roughly chopped, sprinkled with dried wild oregano, doused with olive oil, and then roasted with a little garlic and a lot of red onion, according to Nigella Lawson. The reader is able to imagine Italy and taste the vegetables voyeuristically through the narrative. Even without precise quantities or detailed cooking instructions, the recipe is able to inspire the reader with novel possibilities proposed and new techniques for cooking and presenting a dish. And beyond the content level, we have a sense of the personality of the writer and the world from which the recipe originates. Recipes may be the best manual of all in that even if you dont follow all the steps, it doesnt mean you wont have success. In fact, the recipe may be even better.Recipes: The instruction manuals you actually want to read foodJulian Pinilla / Alligator StaffNice Peters Last Show Audience member Guillermo Montecelo, 24, joins Nice Peter, 34, during his set at High Dive on Sunday.

Cool completely before frosting. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Lower six large organic eggs into the rapidly boiling water. Simmer for exactly nine minutes. (For a slightly runny center, cook the eggs for eight minutes.) Remove the eggs from the boiling water and plunge them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. When the eggs are cool (this doesnt take very long), tap the shells on the counter to crack them, then return the eggs to the ice water. This will allow the cold water to seep between the eggs and the shells, making the eggs easily peelmoist, soft yolk.(1) Installing a Network Security Key (2) Cake Box directions (3) Soft-center Hard-cooked eggs, from David Tanis A Platter of Figs and Other Recipes

Nevertheless, my lack of soccer knowledge didnt stop me from cheering on the Red, White and Blue on Tuesday amid a throng of drunken spectators in The Rowdy Reptile. I celebrated each of Tim Howards 16 saves. I groaned at Chris Wondolowskis blunder in the 93rd minute. I screamed, I believe that we will win, along with my intoxicated brothers and I meant every word. OK, so maybe I still cant recite the Yanks instead of a pitch. Maybe I still call it soccer and not futbol. So what? For the most part, soccer fan groups like the American Outlaws have been welcoming new followers of the game ever since the World Cup kicked off in June. However, there is still a pretentious cionados. What are you guys complaining about? Landon Donovan, who was left off the U.S. roster for the World Cup, put his bitterness aside and encouraged the American public (the entire American public) to skip work and support its country by tuning in. Thats what I did and, as a result, I learned to appreciate the sport and its players a lot more than I have in the past. As frustrating as it might be for lifelong fans to see hoards of bandwagoners talk out of their asses about something they dont really know much about, the result may soon be worth it. Four years from now when the U.S. competes in Russia during the 2018 World Cup, many of todays bandwagon fans may be veteran members of the American Outlaws. The sport needs to grow somewhere and its up to the lifers to help integrate the newer followers into the fanbase to ensure the future popularity of the game. Those who have been following the U.S. mens national team before it was popular have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for soccers reputation in the upcoming Embrace the bandwagonersDesign and build team announced for ODomeCamp kicks off Friday Jonathan Czupryntwitter: @jczupryn

ASSOCIATED PRESSSAO PAULO  Turns out Jurgen Klinsmann was right: The United States isnt ready to win the World Cup. The Americans were eliminated in the round of 16 for the second straight tournament. Theyve been ranked 13th or 14th every month since September, which means their Clearly it gives you the message you have a lot of work still ahead of you, the U.S. coach said Wednesday, a day after the 2-1 loss to BelKlinsmann was a World Cup champion as a player with West Germany in 1990 and coach of the German team that reached the 2006 fornia in 1998 with his American wife, he is seen as bringing the perspective of soccers elite to a nation that remains a new world in the sport. His message to players is they dont do enough. They dont play twice a week, like Champions League stars. They dont face condemnation from their community after losses and poor performances. It makes them feel accountable, not just walk away with a bad performance and nothing happens, he said. If you have a bad performance, then people should approach you and tell you that, so make sure and that you step it up. which kicked off at 4 p.m. EDT on a weekday, was seen by 21.6 million on ESPN and Univision, impressively close to the record 24.7 million set for a Sunday evening game against Portugal earlier in the tournament. An average of 1.6 million watched the loss to Belgium on digital streams. People now start to care about it. Fans care about it. They comment on social media. They comment everywhere about it, and thats good, Klinsmann said. His most controversial moves coming into the tournament were cutting Landon Donovan, the biggest star in U.S. soccer history, and taking along 19-year-old Julian Green, 20-year-old DeAndre Yedlin and 21-year-old John Brooks. Brooks and Green responded with late-game goals when they came in as substitutes, and Yedlin was stellar against Belgium when he replaced injured right back Fabian Johnson. But Klinsmanns proclamation that the U.S. would play an attacking game didnt pan out. The Americans were outshot by a combined 92-41. The interesting part is every time we would go down a goal, well shift it up, he said. I believe its more a mental topic that we have to work on than it is a talent topic.

OConnell Center renovations still $15 million away from goal the 2003 and 2013 renovations to the west side of Ben The indoor tennis facility that CPPI worked on also bears the name of the company namesake Charles R.

Tallahassee-based TLC Engineering has worked on numerous projects across the state, including Florida Internationals football stadium, PGA national resort and spa, the Amway Center and the Citrus Bowl. The company specializes in engineering projects related to airports and hospitals, which make up the bulk of TLCs design portfolio. In June, athletics director Jeremy Foley stated that the OConnell Center renovations are still $15 million away from a price tag that should exceed $50 million once all work has been completed, which would make the renovations the priciest UAA facility overhaul since the $52 million expansion of the west side If the project goes as planned and the funding of 2015.

Many across the world got a glimpse of the crowds at Soldier Field in Chicago the Power & Light District in Kansas City, Mo., and the Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C. And they liked what they saw, which was a youthful, rowdy mob of individuals banding together to cheer for their country. So we might not live on soccer like other nations do, but when the time comes we know how to throw a party and support the Red, White and Blue. That sentiment will only grow as the years go by. But even as an admitted bandwagon fan, I get upset when I see self-proclaimed zealots of U.S. soccer preach about aspects of the sport they really know nothing about (watch Jimmy Kimmel call out ignorant fans by asking them about Landon Donovans performance during this years World Cup). If you just started watching soccer, admit it. Youre not impressing anyone by faking your way through a conversation. Every fan has got to start somewhere so admit you know nothing and work on it. Do your research. Watch some matches. Jump on the bandwagon and get comfortable. Im in this for the long haul. How about you? ZOOPS SCOOP, from page 17
