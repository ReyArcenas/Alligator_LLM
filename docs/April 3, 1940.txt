Gatormen meet in th' old gymnasium. The F par :y hold iLrally in the new gym. A record vote is anticipated by Wilson Freeman, chairman of elections. Opposing a 150 vote adva.ntage in the fraternity voice, the F party rests its hopes upon securing a large enough majority of the non-fraternity vo:e to offset this advantage. In the elections last year, about 2,400 votes were cast. The Gator party carried 13 out of 23 campus-wide positions.

Few institutions have experienced the phenomenal growth passed through by this University. Truly, its development has been progressive. But the University and the state have overlooked one vital addition to this school; an engineering experimental research station. An established fact in more than 30 states throughout the nation and an integral part of every big business institution in this country, benefits to the state, its people and this University from such an agency are immeasurable. The Universiy of Florida and the Sunshine state are closer to an engineering research laboratory than they have ever been. At this moment there is a bill, before the United States congress, sponsored by representatives and snaors of this tate, to provide the necessary fund for its construction. If the bill is passed, the University of Florida would receive $10,000 annually from the Federal government for industrial research which would be increased to $25,000 if the state provides an additional $15,000. This money would be used to construct a research laboratory whose work it would be to develop Florida's industries, discover new uses for Florida's natural resources, and protect Florida's beauty. Benefits an experimental research could give to this state are innumerable. Purpose of this special edition has been two-fold.

Contrary to the prevalent supposition that men enrolled in the engineering school keep their noses deep in the books, facts show that almost every phase of University life finds engineer undergraduates participating. Proof is exemplified in Gregory Hobbs, engineering senior, presdent of the Benton engineering society, chairman of this year's fair and member of the faculty athletic committee, organization spotlighted so frequently during the last few weeks. One of many in the sports limelight from the school is "Red" Stephenson,.captain of last year's track team Gordon Gardner, up and coming engineer, has won letters in boxing and football; BenWEDNESDAY, APIWj -w w ~ w ww -~-~ I S-OPHOMORES L E T I HOLMES ALEXANDER HINTON BAKER BILL NRA RALPH TURLINGTON SERVE YOU ON THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL I I I I I I I I 1 I I I nett Allen, member of two winning swimming teams, and Nor. ris, whose activities have been many. Of note is the fact that all top ranking ROTC officers last year were engineering st-udents in addition to a large percentage of the men in higher positions. Due to the general college program most engineers now take five years to complete their training. This gives them a great deal of leisure time in which to participate in extra-curricular activities, Norris said. Consequently the number of engineers taking part in campus activities has grown steadily. Polarized Light Polarized light has been an accepted scientific tool for some time, and until recently is use has been lmited to scien-fic instruments ana some of the aspects of photography. It is now common practice to use polarizing lenses in sun glasses and recent experiments indicate that it may be the means of eliminating the glare from Most Qualified F Seminle BWMi.'

Co-op Idea Yields Better Engineers By Actual Work One uniqit feature of Florida's eng-nering school is its cooperatiVe pian with many or Flornda's industrie.:j. Based on the partnership idea unftng the eampus College of Engineering with busineenterprises throughout the state, work of the plan is to school a man on the campus for six months and harm him out applying his book-learned knowledge in actual industry. Conceived in 1936 by Blake R. Van Lee, former dean of tne engineering college, the idaa has made long and rapid striei, expanding continually since its rnception. Co-op students are teamed in groups of two; while one at-tends school here the other is off-campus working industry, and vice versa. Preliminaries to entrance into this program include a fuil year of school attendance enrolled in courses leading to a degie in engineering, and an honor poin: rating of "C" or better. Correlation of instruction and application has proven a beneficial idea, developing better and more versatile men than under any other system tried here, according to sponsors of the idea. Besides becoming adept in engineering skills, embryo engineers develop ability to contact and dealing with clientele. Swimmers le turna Florida's four man swimming team of Sonny Welch, Bill Van Clief, Chic Acosta, and Joe Rood, returned early Monday from the National Intercollegiate swimming meet held in Yale pool at New Haven,. Conn. Coach Genovar said that the boys failed to garner any points but that they all gave a good account of themselves. Michigan was declared the final winner, nosing out Yale by a score of 45 to 41. Sigma Tau Has Many Chapters In U. S. Sigma Tau, national honorary engineering fraternity with chapters at 25 major engineering colleges, and the only honorary engineering fraternity at the University of Florida, serves to unite the students into a fraternal organization. T h i s engineering honorary takes its membership only from the upper third of the junior and senior classes. Through the organization is national in scope, its chapters make a concerted drive to promote local activity in an effort to prove beneficial to locally interested members. One of many outstanding activities carried on by the organization's national is the sponsoring of the Sigma Tau scholarship, awarded once each year to the outstanding students of the 25 chapters. Of note is the annual Sigma Tau freshman award for excellence in first year engineerihg courses on campuses where chapters of the organization are located. Leader among honoraries of a like nature, Sigma Tau is represented on campuses of the nation's top industrial and engineering schools. "gave the rule in a negative form to give force to a positive statement."ACP). PAGE FIV:. Mechanical Engineers Build The Largest Wind Tunnel In Florida Feature of the College of Engineering's mechanical department is a high-speed wind velocity tunnel, largest in the state. and made entirely by membh rs of the school's faculty and student enrollment. y The tunnel is of the air recirculation type, having a maximum wind velocity of 100 mles per hour. A six component balance system is under construction now to wigh the forces acing on the model, which will be su.sended in the moving air stream. The balances will be operated by electric motors and vill -e compl-tely automatic in operation. The air circulated :hrough the tunnel is moved by a four-bladed propeller which is driven by an electric motor. The air after leaving the propeller is guided around the corners of the tunnel by means of guide vanes, accelerated to its maximum velocity by passing through a nozzle and then across the open test section into a receiving cone. MODEL SUSPENDED The model is su.z;pnded in the moving air stream by three struts which hold the model in a fixed position and transmit the forces to the balance system which is located over the tunnel. A model may be moved into any of the normal flying positions will be representative of the actual forces experienced by a full sized airplane. THOMPSON DRAWS PLANS First plans for the tunnel were drawn by Professor' R. A. 'hompaon. The mechanical engineering department's techniclan, Charles Swartz, has contributed all of the precision machine work involved. Strictly non-aeronautical projects which ar? awaiting final completion of the tunnel include small saiLng craft sail problemrn; o.-.taining daa to determine the most suitable types of building construction to be used to withstand .vinds of hurricane intensity; and the design of lw resistance trailer bodie;. for hauling Florida's produce.

SAM Studies Problems Of Management BY BILL SCHAUB The youngest, yet one of the most active engineering organizations on the campus is the S ciety for the Advancement of Management. SAM is the student chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Management. It was formed at the University of Florida late in 1936 from the local Society of Industrial Engineers to fulfill a professional consciousness and desire for affiliation with a national organization. FEATURES FILM This year SAM is featuring the testing laboratory as its main exhibit for the Engineer's Fair. A film depicting various scenes of engineering activity on the campus will be shown by one of the members. The routing of the visitors and the location of the exhibits is being handled by SAM along with the short program in the auditorium at the opening of the fair. opMemoership in this organization is open to any student interested in industrial management. Student members alternate with local business men in leading discussion on various problems related to industrial management. COMPETE FOR TROPHY Each year all of the student chapters of SAM compete for the Trundle trophy. Points are awarded on the basis of attendance, outside speakers, field trips. joint meetings and student activities. Last year the local chapter finished se,.d in the college division. Student members take an active part in the annual Engineers' Field day, and this year are considered to be Phe favored contenders for the championship cup. "Advanced Management.' the official publication of SAM is issued quarterly.

The bi-partisan rally, started and sponsored by the executive council, showed in its small beginning that students of the University prefer to compare their candidates on the platform rather than in the rah-rah, smoke-filled amosphere of a pre-election part rally. By hearing both candidates for the major offices, students are better equipped to vote for the best man. Thanks a lot, executive council, for giving us the opportunity to hear and see the candidates for both sides. Let us hope that the new executive council will realize the success of the bi-partisan rally and will establish it as a yearly event. Let's develop the bi-partisan rally into the biggest feature of election week. .A Privilege And A Duty Tomorrow every Florida student gets is annual op portunity to express his views toward student government on the campus. Whichever way you cast your ballot, cast it. Nothing is more indicative of the interest you hold in your student government than the attitude you hold toward voting. If you don't vote, let not your cries be heard next year, that our student government is no good. If you do vote, and your candidates lose, look forward to another election, but be a good sport. You've heard it before and you'll hear it many times again -an institution is only as strong as its weakest citizen. Don't be the weakest citizen in the institution of student government on this campus. VOTE TOMORROW. Quotable Quotes "I hope you never belong to Youth with a capital 'Y'.

By MARGARET PAINTER Tally, April 2 While political campaigning is at its peak for you Florida men this week, we of Tally saw our new officers installed Monday night with the traditional ceremony in front of Bryan hall.

Outgoing president of college government. Kathryn Graham installed the incoming president Cornelia Watson, and outgoing chairman of judiciary, Marjorie Jessup,.invested her successor, Carolyn Mims. The newly installed president then invested all other officers. SOME WEEKEND With General college festivities and the selection of a queen to preside over them, the Florida relays and the crowning of a relays queen, who also presided over the "F" club dinner dance, last weekend was definitely a success as to fun and excitement, say the Tally girls who were your guests. Everyone agrees that Jack Teagarden was plenty all right and that the dances were wonderful. Since GC is not such a big weekend, the gym isn't so crowded that one can't move, and the dances are much more fun. "We're for these small weekends," say the FSC girls. The "F" club weekend climaxed with a dinner dance Saturday night, was lots o fun, say those of us who were escorted by "F" club members. Here's hoping it will be an annual event from now on. While many of us were playing with you in Gainesville, those who remained got quite a thrill when the Cadet Glee club from the U. S. Naval air station in Pensacola came over and presented a concert. Following the concert, the boys were '/aored by the seniors with a dance in Landis recreation room. When the dance was over. the boys stood in the patio of Landis hall and serenaded the girls. The girls who were lucky enough to have dates with the glee ctib members were quite thrilled. (There's something about 'a uniform that gets a Woman every time, you know.y QUIET WEEKEND The coming weekend will be a comparatively quiet one at Florida State, the only social functio'7 planned being the Alpha Gamma Delta formal dance.

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," starring Raymond Massey with Gene Lockhart and Ruth Gordon. Feuds, robberies and the quarrels of sweethearts keep Jane Withers and Gene Autry on the go all the time in the picture "Shooting High" which is showing at Ehe Florida for the last time today. Jane helps Gene round up a band of '5Ank-robbers, break up a family feud and patch up a misunderstanding with the girl of Gene's dreains, in the person of Marjorie Neav-er. "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" opens at the Florida theatre for a twoday run Thursday and Friday of this week. The story covers more than 30 years of Lincoln's life, from his awkward adolescence inthe Illinois backwoods to the fateful time when, about to be inaugurated as president, he leaves Springfield for the capital. In that span it crowds a lifetime of gripping, absorbing entertainment that makes it easily one of the finest pictures ever produced anywhere, and a picture every American should see. Raymond Massey, for whom the original stage play was especially written, gives a portrayal of Lincoln that won him nation-wide recognition during the Broadway run. Gene Lockhart as Stephen Douglas, Ruth Gordon as Mary Todd Lincoln and Mary Howard as Ann Rutledge, head the fine supporting east. week-and don't let those elections get you too steamed up. It's wonderful to win. the confidentially (frorn one who has been), it isn't such a terrible calamity to be defeated.

In 1930 this group formally organized as "The Cnemical Engixeering Society" and functioned Under this name until 1932 when hR petition for membership into AIChE was granted and the Uni,vewrity of Florida student branch the American Institute of I-themical Engineers came into exIstance. s: RCE FIRST PRESIDENT First officers of "The Chemical Sgineering Society" af ter its orgiwfnization were: Owen Rice, P President; J. B. David, vice-presMiit; L. M. Emmanuel, secretary'raswer. Most of the activities that year centered around tne Pu~beme of getting the society Organized, interspersed with talks on chemical engineering by variOus members of the faculty. Growth through the years has been marked by a constantly exPanding and progressing program Of activity. In addition to annual awards to outstanding freshman doing chemical engineering work, Ae dub has sougnt to brng in&)rited speakers to the campus. Taking an active part in the Ji neer's Fair has long been a Standing rule of order with AIChE. Developments in chemical enAlfeering by the group have been Paced by the type of speaker brought to the camp-us and the 84bject of his talks: PRESENT LEADERS This year's officers are: Alfred SMnth, president, W. N. David, Vice-president, C. L. Henkel, secretary-treazurer and Dr. W. HBtisler counselor. The society arranged two plant UISPection trips this year to acqUaint the students with the apParatus used by industry. Several films of a technical n-ft tuft have been shown during the Year.

FINEREN Few realize the intimate relations between the Florida engin2ering Society and the College of Engineering at the Universty of Florida. Since the group's organization, it has worked closely with the college seeking progressive improvements for the University and the state. STATE IN BAD SHA&PE When in 1907, 33 years ago, the U. S. Government sent this writer to Florida, travels over the state disclosed a serious lack of engineering initiative on the part of cities and communities. Local engineers, in the then sparsely settled agricultural and tourist infected areas, were reluctant to suggest heforns .on a large scale (most of them being employed personnel). There were few adequate harbors, s h o r e s and teaches were being washed away: our lakes and inknd streams were neglected; frits were being dumped into tie streams, as ther% weie no canner.es and preserving factories for our surplusses and lower grades' of product; th->usands of acres of productive soil were either in swamp or arid from lack of drainage and irrigation; there were no railroads south of Fort Myers and Miami, and no concrete highway had yet been consructed. Although reports of these conditions were turned in to the government. there was, at that time, no authoritative b-ody to present these defects to the pu"lic.I FES FILLED NEED Seeking to create an organization to fill this need. this writer, Prof. R. E. Chandler and th.2 late Dean J. R. Benton collaborated to start the Florida Engineering society, the event taking place :n December, 1916, at a meeting of more than 100 engineers in Jackonville. City in the state as far am they related to engineering science and construction. Re.porV~ were prepared and read at the annual conventions and published in newspapers throughout t h e state. To theoe technical report9 and convention resolutions, much of the -ngineerng and constructive activity in the state is due. Since the society's inception, it has continually advocated and promoted issues likely to help the state progress. Concentration has been centered on bringing about improved engineering practices. Latest objective of the society is the proposed engineering experiment station, a bill for which Li before congress at pr'?sent. While a great deal of work has been carried out in this ccnnection and 4n other fields of engineering by the faculty of the college of engineering, n( appropriations have, as yet, teen made by our state legislature for the work. The Florida Engineering societv has continued throughout these year. to advocate a sustantial and thoroughly -equipped and financed engineering experiment station at the University. It has also created the Benton Engineering -society at the U rNv.rsity as a "student chapter, having all reasonable privileges of the parent society.

This may be done secretly or openly. as it strikes you. The only difference is that you might be forced to serve your term of office while you were serving another term. Also recommended is that you buy a big gun, hold up the polls, and stuff the ballot box.

If you're like everybody else. you can hire your two hundred pounds and get just as effective results. You might buy every voter three bottles of beer or a 1910 Mercury, which ever best fits your pocketbook. This is vastly effective and positively insures yo,; election. You might fool both parties by telling one you're on their side and telling the other you're on their side. This may get involved after a short length of time, but if you're a mastermind and a genius everything will be fine. oIf he is a mastermind ot a genius he wouldn't be running for a political office anyway!

THE FLORIDA ALLIGATOR EIGT.f Fair Opens As Green Speaks At Banquet Andrews, Shroeder Among Brightlights Attending Affair Inauguration of Friday evening's campus affairs in conjunction with the Engineer's Fair will be a banquet in Florida Union, to be attended by almost every big name in the state. Congressmen, state officials, faculty leaders, politicians, alumni and friends of the college of engineering have been invited. Representative Lex ,G r e e n, Florida congressman who introduced the bill to prcvide the University with an engineering exAnother limelighted visitor, U. perimental research laboratory, will be the honored guest and main speaker. # S. Senator Charles 0. Andrews, will be on hand. Andrews collaborated with Green in an effort to secure the passage of the research station bill. Roy Shroeder, state administrator for the W.P.A., who is scheduled to take part in Friday afternoon's hydraulics lab dedication, will also attend the banquet. Florida's faculty will be represented by Dr. Jno. J. Tigert, University president, Deans Josepli Weil, R. C. Beaty, F. J. Matherly, T. W. Simpson and Townes R. Leigh. The banquet will mark the official opening of the fair following which all exhibits and demonstrations will be thrown open to the public. AIEE Seeks To Develop Talents Of Members BY VERNON MOORE Actual production of glass from Florida sand and an extensive display of recently developed glass products will be a feature -the American Institute of Chemical Engineers chapter exhibits at the 1940 Engineers' Fair. The exhibit is planned to show how an engineering experiment station could develop the glassmanufacturing industry in this state. The large supply of sand available in this state presents an opportunity for research and a challenge to Florida engineers and business leaders. Although carried on to a small extent, glass manufacturing in Florida has been limited by inadequate research. SEEK MATERIALS The development of new uses for glass has augmented the search for new glass-making materials. Sand obtained as a byp-cduct in the purification of Florida clays has been found particularly suitable in making certain types of glass. A demonstration of small-scale glass manufacture, and displays of Florida kaolin, before and after purification, will be presented at the exhibit. DISPLAY AT FAIR The display of new glass products, a result of engineering research in recent years, should be of interest to fair-goers. Several types of glass cloth, glass insulation tape, glass wool, glass brick, and filters will be shown. These new products promise to be of considerable economic importance. It is also planned to have a University glass technicon give a demonstration of g -s-blowing. Benjamin Cottle, Woodrow 4~~nn Vpr .I 1~-nn Moorp'c Industry Takes A 11 Industrial Engineers Constant growth year by year typifies activitiy of the industrial department of the Engineering college. With more and more facilities and equipment available to students interested in this work matched by an increase in enrollment and graduations, the industrial engineering department has paced the development of the entire college. kstablAined on the sound basis of engineering training, coupled with a knowledge of business administration, this department collaborates with other schools and colleges on the campus in turning out well-rounded industrial engineers. Graduates find factory employ, work as salesmen, advisers as technical experts and personnel work, according to Prof. P. 0. Yeaton, head of this phase of campus engineering. Unique tact is tne absence of unemployment among graduates graduates of the industrial department. Gator alumni who matriculated through industrial engineering are employed in industry doing everything from shipbuilding to advising insurance corporations. Demand for industrial engineers has closely paralleled the supply of them. Foundry Display Is Fair Brightlight Friday Night BY W. L. BASSETT In a spectacular display of fire and white-hot liquid iron, students of the mechancal engineeding department will thrill spectators at 9 o'clock Friday night with a foundry demonstr-ation. Amid roaring furnaces and dazzling lights similar to the spectacle of many huge oteel mills, iron will be heated to a temperature at which it flows like water, and poured into sand molds to form intricate machine frames and parts. Every phase of the process from the wooden pattern to the finished casting will be displayed and fully explained. Open molds will enable the visitor to trace the path of the molten iron as it flows from the ladle into every small crevice to form an exact duplicate of the pattern desired. Lathe beds, surface plates, pulleys, gas engine cylinders, and numerous other machine parts will be 'made. A small glass modelbof the cupola, or melting furnace will show how the metal is heated by means of coke fuel. The foundry exhibit was awarded first place as themost noteworthy and spectacular demonstration of the Engineers' Fair two years ago. This year it promises to be even better. Visitors who have never had the opportunity of visiting a foundry in operation will undoubtedly remember the spectacle as the highlight of the evening.

Have You Got Whooping Cough? Eat A Live Fish And Cure It Did you ever see a fish with whooping cough? Somewhere, back in the dim ancestral past, you might have expected to if you were up to date on your remedies. Such, at least, is the thesis advance oy Dr. Carl A. Wilzbach, Cincinnati Health Commissioner. All students in the art of selfmedication, those would-be doctors who have a medicine kit, will be interested in several rules-of-thumb remeries once devoutly accepted as medical gospel by the unmedical uncovered ty Dr. Wilzbach. SANDWIcHES AND GOLD FISH Two cures existed for whooping cough. Either (1 1 the victim might be cured by plang a hair from his head between slices of bread and butter and feeding the impormtu .andxich to a dog. If the dog coughed, he had acquired the whoop. Or, (2> the patient might be cured by placing a live fish in his mouth --college gold fish swallowers take note-then returning the fish to the water where it would give the whooping cough to all the other fish. Proof of the cure was the fact that the fish could be seen coming to the surface to cough. Way back then they believed that a worm inside a tooth caused it to ache. They to cure toothache was to fumigate the tooth with incense or tobacco, supposedly to sufficate the imaginary early-bird bait. SURE CURE A cure for a pain in the back was to turn three somersaults backward the first time the patient heard thunder. This method was positively guaranteed. It either cured the patient or killed him, and either way he had no more pain in the back. A sure cure for catarrah was to kiss a mule. (Mules aren't as hard to find as coeds on the Florida campus with the ag school here.) Not so long ago a farmer out west advised as a preventative of disease, especially of colds, to keep a live skunk in the house. Possibly this was done with the idea that any one who could learn to be indifferent to a skunk wouldn't be bothered by a common cold. WORSER AND WORSER Another curious belief was in a "sympathy" treatment for wounds. If a man were stabbed it was customary to bind the wound with clean rags and leave it untouched for seven days, and to put salve on the weapon which caused the injury. The Health Commissioner said that when the potato was first introduced into Europe it was not used as a food but as a medicine. It was considered to be a powerful and rare drug and was priced accordingly. Maybe tomorrow scholars will look back on this generation in scorn and say: "Back then they used to put some red water and a white piece of cloth on their finger when they cut it-tch tch, such foolishness." Could be. Black Light An early dictionary defines light as "the imponderable agent by which objects are rendered visible by its action on the retina." We must make some exceptions in the case of "black light." Only objects which have been specially treated are visible under this type of luminescence. A display of this unusual development is included in "Research on Parade." Lighting Changes Night To Day At Florida Field Changing night into day was an impossibility 50 years ago. Thanks to the inventive genius of Edison and the skill of the engineer, it can be done now with relative ease. The lighting of Florida Field is an example of changing night into day. Pofesso W. L. Sawyer (designed the six ixhting towers that rear eet into the sky. Funds :f. the tOWrs cane jointly f r k m Miss Geor,ia Seagle. an -Ild friend of the l'niversit, and t e Foderal goveinment. The seui was su plied by The Aetna lion and St eel Company, the organization wiich supervised the erection the towers. Carlton Mann, Florida alumnus, was in charge. Labor was supplied by the WPA. In the erection of the towers difficulty was experienced in getting a proper foundation. One of the tower's foundation extends down for more than 25 feet beneath the surface. The average depth ,f the foundations is a little move than 15 feet. Professor J. W. Wilson designed the lighting equipment. His design provdes for 25 lunens per square foot, iore light per square fcot than rmiost libraries can boast. The cost pel hour with all six towers on is s.20.

Thompson, honorary chairman; Curtis Stanton, chairman; Fred Tunis, vice-chairman; Darby Jones, secretary; Lewis Jenkins, treasurer. The American society of mechanical engineers is a national professional society of graduate mechanical engineers whose aim is to promote the advancement of mechanical engineering, and to promote a closed alliance between society as a whole and the engineering profession. The ASME maintains a student branch of the organization at each engineering college in the country. Rules and by-laws for the student branches are the same as for the national society. Aim of the student branch is to bring about a closer alliance between student mechanical engineers, and to promote better fellowship. The student branch in weekly meetings, provides students the opportunity to meet and discuss views on different phases of the engineering. Each semester a paper contest is held for the student branch here. The paper can be on any subject pertaining to mechanical engineering. Fred Tunis won the first semester contest. He not only received $5 for his efforts, but was selected to give his paper on "Photoelasticity" at the state meeting of the ASME at Hollywood. The winning paper this semester was given by Curtis Stanton who received $5, and his expenses paid to Birmingham. He will give his paper there at the meeting of the student branches of all the *1 I, 'I

Their total, gained by wins in the hop-step and jump and 880yard relay and a third in the shot put, doubled the total of Shadowlawn, second place team. FLETCHER F FIRST Fletcher F took first honors in the dorm league when Jim Valade, husky football star, won the shot put and discus throw with little difficulty. Sledd A added three points for its second place relay team, to second in the hopstepand jump for runner-up bonors with six points. Wb A. Fletcher, Murphree G, and Pht Reen, Murphree D, won the other events that went to the finals. Fletcher jumped 5'6" to win the high jump, and Pat Reen took first in the running broad jump with a leap of 19'8". Finals in the standing broad jump, 100 and 220-yard dashes, 70-yard high hurdles, and 120yard low hurdles will be run off Friday afternoon. SLEDD A LEADS Sledd A qualified a man in each event, to top themdorm league. Shadowlawn and Radians placed men in four of the events for top honors in the independent league. Other teams which have men in the finals are CLO Thomas C-E, Floridians, .Fletcher K-L, Buckman C, Sledd H, Barracks, )Aurphree D, and Murphree G. Continued from one featured exnioit by the mechanical division of wind tunnel principles and practices, accompanied by an extensive spread of documents and articles sponsored by the technical department of the college and the CAA ground school courses. Other limelighted displays are treatments of various phases in the development of Florida's resources, stressing methods of orange juice canning and paper production from state pine forests. Another chemical engineering booth presents a glass working model of a modern sulfuric acid plant, proposed to show the public chemistry's place in the present industrial age. Road and bridge construction plays a featured role in Friday evening's industrial pov-wow with a prominent exhibition of a model clover leaf highway intersection, built to scale by students in the civil engineering school. A steel bridge and pavement model rounds out uhs all-important feature of Florida progress.

Gardner was trying for 6 feet 3 inches when he hurt his ankle and retired for the afternoon. Gardner also qualified in the 70-yard high hurdle and 120-yard low hurdle events. Intramural board members late last night ruled that the final events which had been run off Monday were legal. since the fraternities had not been notified that anything more than preliminaries would be held. Therefore, finals will be held in all events Friday, Manager Bobby Patterson and student director Maurice Austin announced. Kearney Wins Union Award Francis Kearney, veteran Florida track star,rnas voted by the board of managers of Florida Union as the most outstanding Gator athlete of the 1938-39 school year and, as a result, his picture will be hhng in the Union game room along with that of WValter "Tiger" Mayberry, the first winner of the award. The eventual aim of the board is a hall of fame for Gator athletes. The selection of Kearney was based upon his outstanding track performances last year. At present Kearney is serving his second season as co-captain of the track team and he is holder of the Southeastern conference championship in the 100 and 220-yard dashes. special divisions are supervised by the Benton Engineering Society, an organization including all University students in engineering.

Record Behind BY PAUL ROGERS Dick Tench, "the statesmanpolitician," will complete a sixyear college education this semester to graduate with an enviable record as a Floricla man and with a good deal of promise for a successful law career. Dick's bigr field is "student government." In 1938-'39 he was chancellor of the honor court. That same year Tench's name wa.s in "Who's Who Among Students in American Colleges and Universities." Dick has also been active as a leader in the formation of political parties-most important of which was probably the Gator party. Det'ating and speech making throughout the state on honor court tours and the like are activities which Dick has participated in. Last year when there was a little trouble, that doesn't need mentioning, Dick was asked by certain officials exactly what he thought should be done to better a condition believed to have been the reason for the trouble. Finally, a plan was worked out whereby two football .players now live in each section of the dormitories instead of the Gator club--resulting in a better feelingbetween the students and the team. Dick was instrumental in making swimming a major sport. For two weeks Dick worked to get 2500 names on petitions to bring this about. Five of these days, operations had to te carried on from his room since he was taken ill with asthma. Dick's latest work has been revising the constitution in collaboration with John Cotton Brown, Tom Wakefield, D i c k Anderson, and Bill McRae. It was duty to revise the j"ficial portion of the constitution as well to help with the rest. AE Continued from one Tally, this year's AEE group contains 30 members. Meetings are held every two weeks at which members present papers on general engineering subjects, listen to talks by representatives Ofestate and national corporations and take in engineering films. The organization plans a trip through the state to visit such places of engineering interest as power plants and will attend the district meeting of the AIEE at Mississippi State College on April 12 and 13.

Pointing to the need of I bud reau of industrial research and adequate financing of the engia neering experiment station, Co lee said that "the contributions to Florida's citizenship, to agriculture, and in many other did rections, has been magnificent .nd l too little understood, alp preciated, and supported. "I think one of the first dud ties of the next Governor of this state should be to insist on adequate financing for the University so that it is given a chance to render to this wonderful state a full measure of the service that is within its scope. It is unpardonabk that adequate fia nancing has not been provided to enable well trained faculty and staff men in many fields, to attend meetings and conferences in this state where their knowle(Ig,, and experience would be ind valuable."

The industrial engineering department, -youngest in the college, was established in 1934. Prof. P. 0. Yeaton has served as head since its organization. Dean Van Leer served as dean of the college uV'il 1937, when he resigned. Prof. V;,eil was th-n appointed acting dean. An engineering experiment station was organized in 1929 to serve the state of Florida. In recent years through this agency, active contacts have been made with industry and some amount of researches have been carried on, notably in hurricane location, in which Dean Weil has participated intensively. A $100,000 cyclotron is being constructed in St. Louis. by Washington university. I A --.5 *. 1965, there was included inI ical school with courses offered in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. At the time of its organization, the college of engineering had only three departments with Dr. Benton, Prof. Cox and Prof. Kicklighter as heads of these departments. The late Dr. Benton served as dean of the school from 1909 until his death in 1930. Col. E. S. Walker, who is still with the college, was elected secretary at the same time. When this organization took place, the en*rollment of the entire University was 181 with 49 in the engineering college. At the end of the year 1910, there were two graduates from the college of engineering. Drawings and mechanical arts, under the supervision of Prof. A. J. Strong, because a part of the mechanical department in 1913. This was made into a separate department in 19)20. CEICAL WORK-1917 One year later, in 1917, chemical engineering was added to the curriculum of the college and was administered by the department of chemistry. Prof. Reed was made head of the civil department in 1919, and serves as its head today. When the University moved from Lake City to Gainesville in the 'early 1909's, the only buildings on the campus were Buck.man Hall, Thomas Hall, and the machine shop. The latter is now the post office. Later, south of Buckman Hall, a small frame building was erected for use as an electric laboratory after some electrical equipment was brought from Lake City. NO FUNDS-DIFFICULTY Owing to lack of funds and labor, some difficulty was encountered in the construction of this building and it acquired the name of "Calamity hall." Early apparatus of the machine shop insisted of a planer, a lathe, and a milling machine. The forge Zhop had three Or four forges, and in the wood sh6p th college boasted a circular saw, a planer, and three sma-l wood turning lathes. To compare this meager assembly of equipment with what the college has at present indicates the wealth of shop tools that have been acquired during the short space of 20 to 25 years. The recently acquired hydraulies laboratory, one of the finest in the country, suggests a college by its massive appearance and specially designed interior. Prof. Lowe, now head of the department of civil engineering at Auburn university completed the design before leaving the University to take his new post in Alabama. ARCHITECTURE In 1926, the department of architecture was formed and became a part of the engineering college. Its present head, RuExecutive Council Minutes February 29, 1940 The special meeting of the executive council was called to order by vice-president Poucher in the absence of the presid-nt.

Sleuth Daniel Heads Legal Frat Engineers Utilize Photography For Keeping Records Photography plays an lmn ant part in the work of today's engineer. The modern constructional engineer keeps a complete photographic record of all his work in addition to other written notes, etc. Actions of liquids and movements of high speed machinery are now being photographed at speed as high at 1-100,000 of a second with still and motion picture cameras. Results are the stopping of practically all movement. By examination of the photographs, one is able to analyze these actions and movements and in the case of the high speed machinery see and determme just what effects are taking place. EXAMPLE For example, a high speed moving picture made of the firing of a bullet from a gun through an electric light bulb will show the bullet slowly entering one side of the bulb and emerge from the other side following the gradual disintigration of the bulb. Action may be stopped at any moment by stopping the projector. USED IN SURVEYING In the field of map making and surveying photography is now playing an important part. Areas which, by the use of the regular surveying instruments, would have taken months or even years to survey now can be accurately mapped by a few men using modern aerial photographic methods in a few days and with a high degree of accuracy. In a recent aerinl mapping survey in Columbia, South America an accuracy was obtained of 2PO-.351 meters as to a measured distance of 2899.376 meters. This is but one of the new subjects added to the engineering curriculum by the industrial engineering department. "Laburnum Grove," Florida PAayers next production, went into rehearsal this week under the direction of Prof. Paul E. Geisenhof, department of speech. The trio of veterans who were cast for leading roles last week, v:ere joined Monday when Bob Anderson received a part. Remembered especially for his actng in "Room Service." v(oCmedy presentation last fall, Anderson nas taken an active interest in dramatics since his enrellment here. Mrs. Wilma Best, who has played in Radio Guild features, will take the third female part, joining Mrs. Sylvia Quade and Alice McKinstrv who were cast previously. Impressario Geisenhof, who scored a major success in his first campus directing attempt, with "Room Service," announced that he will continue -rehearsals until spring holidays. and will hold further rehearsals until the mystery comedy is presented 'April 25, 26, 27.

WEDNESDAY, APRB THE FLORIDA ALLIGATOR Fundless Experiment Station Prints Six Bulletins On Florida Problems By HARRY K. SILER if Chief purpose of the fundless engineering experix station at the University of Florida is to present im tant beneficial data concerning natural resources conditions in the state of Florida. Handicapped by lack of funds the station has no ) able to carry on research to fill the needs of the s Despite this, the personnel of the station has made five important economical installation and studies and issued six bulletins. ation of equipment under F AIAPPING FIRS'A conditions. First bulletin, "Tne Mapping These bulletins containing Situation in Florida" by Prof. W. rThnbinsaon on su L. Sawyer, was directed to tax portent information on su payers, land owners and surveyof interest to every Floridia ors throughout the state. Second available through the offi bulletin, "The Electrical Industry Joseph Weil, director, Eng in Florida" by J. W. Wilson, gives ing Experiment Station. a picture of the industry that affect every user of electricity in Florida. Florida's dreaded bugaboo, the hurricane, is the subject of two bulletins. Bulletin number three by Dean Joseph Weil and Wayne Mason, is "Locating of Tropical Storms by Means of Assciated Static"; and the fourth in the series by Prof. S. P. Sashoff and Weil "On Static Emanating From Six Tropical Storms And Its Use In Locating the Position Of The Disturbance." Further research on this project may aid materially in the saving of many lives and millions of dollars. QUESTIONS Why is Daytona Beach no longer used for record breaking automobile speed runs? What can be done to prevent the deterioration of our beaches? Bulletin number four, covering "A Study of Beach Conditions at Daytona Beach." a report of the engineers of United States War Department with comments by W. W. Fineren, of the College of Engineering, is the answer of Florida's engineering experiment station to these questions. FIFTH ON CONDITIONING Air Conditioning has made great strides in Florida during the past several years. This has been in spite of the fact that climatic conditions in Florida are vastly different from those of other parts of the nation. The fifth project of the experiment station was undertaken to aid the people and industries of the state in realizing the benefits to be derived from air conditioning. "Climatic Data For the Design and Operation of Air Conditioning Systems in Florida," by Professors N. C. Ebaugh and S. P. Goethe, furnishes information necessary to the efficient and 5 GC Debaters Leave On Trip Third and last general college debate tripstarted yesterday when a quartet of speakers and a manager left by car for St. Petersburg. Ansel Wittenstein, Al Cone, Harold Neff, and Jack Nants, debaters, and Bernard Fuchs, manager, will visit thr'fschools in Florida. The debaters speak in Williams P a r k, St. Petersburg, against the junior college, this afternoon, and over the radio toaight. tomorrow, both teams debate at Florida Southern in Lakeland, and close their trip against Stetson Friday. Wittenstein and Cone uphold the affirmative, and Neff and Nants, the negative of the question, Resolved: That legislation be enacted providing for the conscription of capital in the event the United States becomes inyolved in war.

Now may we suggest the following as our opinion for an increased industrial expansion in Florida. A spirit of cooperation must exist between all cities, counties and agencies of our state so that we present a united whole in attracing and locating industries in that portion of the state in which they are best adapted. Power and water must be available, dependable, and cheap. we add skill and power to raw materials, we increase their value. As Competent men shall study, conceive and develop new ideas, both for our existing and for new industries. Laboratories containing testing and experimental apparatus must be available so that these men may efficiently perform their tasks. There must be adequate transportation facilities, making possible the securing of necessary raw materials and then their transportation to the market. Freight rates must be equitable. A cooperative arrangement shall exist between agriculture and 'industry so that industry can, when necessary, augment its labor with workers from the farm, and, vice versa, that the farm can call upon industry for workers when necessity demands it. Industry must feel that the state government always stands ready to assist and protect it and that there will be no excessive confiscatory taxes. Attention must be paid to the conservation of our natural resources and their further development. Industry cannot be built up in a day. To destroy without rebuilding is to rob future generations. These eight points are important -others probably ought to be added. Every Floridian should, indeed, assist in the development of a greater Industrial Florida.

HENKEL The "Age of Plastics," has been applied to his era and it has been through experimental research that these modern materials and products have become available. Nature provides man with vast stores of raw materials but until recent years these have been somewhat limited in their industrial applications. However, through the persistent as framework for modern furefforts of research workers as fn many fielde-these natuA1 materniture. ials have taken new and better To mention one local application of this plastic, the chemithetic products are on the arcal engineering department here kets today to provide better livis using tubes of lucite in the ing for countless people. construction of of an absorption A.ng f r-c-u-tes6.1--eRAYON FAMILIAR Rayon, while relatively new, has become a familiar fabric to all, product of extensive scientitic investigation. The clothing industry has profited greatly by researchers' contributions. Besides rayon new materials now on the markets oro soon to be displayed are the acetate cloths, sharkskin, celenese and nylon. Nylon ia new hosiery material developed by the duPonts and will make its public appearance this spring. Because of its highstrength and elasticity, nylon has greater wearingmuqualities than silk and is much more adaptable. Glass i.s also finding a new application. undreamed of a few years ago. being spun into thread and woven ittti-) cothl. LUCITE SPECTACULAR Probably the most spectacular discovery iin plastics was "Lucite," another duPort contribution. Lucite, an extremely light, transparent material, has the peculiar property of transmitting light around bends and thus has conie into use for dental and broncoscopic flashlights. Lucite Li also being use-i tower so as to observe the action taking place during gas absorption. Plastics have already come into wide and varied uses. Many common household articles formerly made of gla&s3 or wood are now replace by bakelite, catalin, lucite, beetleware, plastocele, tenite or some other modern plastic. SOYBEANS AND PEANUTS Many of these plastics and new materials are made from raw materials of supposedly little industrial importance. Soybeans and peanuts are good examples of what research can do with basic materials. The soybean is used in making m nany of trimming-i on automobiles. In building construction many new and better mateerialsare being made anti used to make safter and more bWautiful. A method of coloring aluminum has increased that material's use as a decorative meal. Discovery of a n'w process in the refining of gasoline has given the public a better material at a lower price.
