Tonight at midnight is when people on the land will be trespassing on the property. However, most of the campers have already moved out of Tent City over the past few weeks. The ones that are left this late might be the ones who need the most help, said Annette Gilley, an Occupy Gainesville member who has been actively helping Gainesvilles homeless. They might be addicted to drugs or mentally ill and havent wanted to move out. Gainesville Police have been visiting Tent City, telling campers of the eviction date and handing out cation opportunities, said GPD Lt. Brian Helmerson. Those who are left will be verbally warned of trespass, then physically arrested or given a notice to appear in court. If they still do not leave, trespassers will be jailed.

I know Tuesday is the last day, but there were a lot of people who didnt want to move this way. To help with the move, the city approved 2,000 one-year bus passes for the ACCHH to give to those who need it. Free bus passes have made it easier for people to get out to us, she said.

Mosquitoes containing the Eastern equine encephalitis virus have been found in Alachua County, and small areas of standing water are their preferred breeding ground. Two horses contracted the virus in late June, and the Alachua County Health Department recently released a mosquito-borne illness advisory to warn county residents on July 1. Eastern equine encephalitis is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that can infect humans and livestock. Symptoms may include fever, headache, dizziness, fatigue and confusion, according to the department. Phillip Kaufman, associate professor of veterinary entomology at UF, said that horses tend to get hit by the outbreaks are more likely to occur shortly after. People are most at risk of being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the virus during the dawn and dusk hours, he said.

Jiang said Alachua County monitors viruses transmitted by mosquitoes using sentinel chickens in coops strategically located around the county.

Anthony Dennis, environmental health director of the Florida Department of Health in Alachua County, said he advises people to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds that typically collect standing water, which include pots, buckets and other containers.

TUESDAY, JULY 8, 2014 ALLIGATOR, 5 THE TEAM NEEDS $50,000. REBECCA KRAVETZAlligator Contributing WriterImagine students completing their homework through a massively multiplayer online role playing game while the user adventures through a unique and exotic world. UF professor Dennis Frohlich, who teaches the class The Cultural Impact of Video Games, said hes never heard of such a thing. Lindsey Tropf, a UF graduate student, wants to make that game a reality. She is launching a Kickstarter on Thursday in hopes of raising $50,000 to create the underlying mechanics of the game. Tropfs game, called Tyto Online, will have its own world, lore, story will also contain a module of ecology set to middle school science standards. Her Gainesville-based educational startup, Immersed Games, aims to develop a virtual world as a platform for learning opportunities. Grade school students will complete quests in subjects like science, math, cial literacy. Tropf, a doctoral candidate in UFs School Psychology Program, has dedicated more than 3,000 hours working with schools. I understand the practical limitations of teachers if they were to want to implement our game in their classroom, she said. Tropf refers to existing educational video games as chocolatecovered broccoli. Developers make educational games like a worksheet of problems  the broccoli  but in a pretty game format  the chocolate. Answering a math problem to shoot a zombie, its fun and novel for a moment, but it isnt true, deep learning and doesnt teach the concepts, Tropf said. (It) just helps students practice them. Immersed Games was founded on the premise that all content should be in one cohesive world where students are able to stumble upon quests for content they never may have known existed otherwise. Frohlich said that kids know right away when a video game is trying to teach them something. He said he is curious about Immersed Games reasoning for using the genre of an MMORPG for an educational game and whether it will be effective. Minecraft has shown that online gaming can be a space for collaboration between players, Frohlich said.

Article X would later birth Tobacco Free Florida, a hugely successful anti-tobacco campaign whose ads continue to make us cringe. If you havent seen the TV spots or billboards, the campaign uses graphic imagery  a girl drinking a beaker of formaldehyde, another girl peeling the skin from her cheek as payment for a pack of cigarettes and testimonials from cancer-stricken adults who were lifelong smokers  to drive home the message that a small action like smoking can harm yourself and others. Today, Floridians are faced with a similar struggle to eliminate a life-endangering habit from its citizens: texting while driving. Like smoking, only weak, virtually unenforceable laws exist to prevent people from texting while driving. Like smoking, texting while driving not only hurts yourself  it hurts others around you. Like smoking, the issue of texting while driving is mired in politics as lawmakers argue that its not the governments duty to regulate behavior. Like smoking a cigarette, sending a text while driving is a tiny action with deadly consequences. Like smokers, people who text and drive know its dangerous, but they do it anyway. As the state examines the ways in which it can battle its texting-while-driving problem, it might help if politicians analyze the success of Tobacco Free Florida and apply the educationas-a-tool-for-change method toward texting at the wheel. The Tampa Bay Times reported on Sunday that Floridas texting-while-driving ban, which makes texting at the wheel a secondary offense, has resulted in just 1,800 citations during er John Woodrow Cox writes, consider: A federal study published last year found that at any given daylight hour, 660,000 drivers nationwide are using cellphones or other electronic Because texting at the wheel is only a secondary offense, police cant pull over a driver for having his or her phone out unless the driver is committing another offense  speeding, not using a seatbelt, etc. Policy has failed when it comes to stopping Florida drivers from texting while driving. Its time, then, to look at more effective methods, and education campaigns such as Tobacco Free Florida have been proven to work. According to Tobacco Free Floridas website, In 2012, the smoking rate of adults in Florida was 17.7%, well below the national average of 19.6%...The number of youth who have pledged never to smoke has increased from 55 percent in 2006 Its up to lawmakers to fund a Florida chapter of a campaign like It Can Wait, AT&Ts national texting-and-driving prevention effort. Education campaigns are effective, and theyre worth the investment. Heres to hoping that politicians and citizens recognize this and demand change. 60 TOTAL VOTES28% YES 71% NOVote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFridays question: Have you ever been to UFs astronomy observatory? Todays question: Do you take offense to gay slurs? NSA needs overhaul, culpability checkT ception of the National Security Agency and how the institution continues to affect our daily lives in a mustwatching this special, one automatically envisions the Orviewees for its documentary special. The pro-NSA camp was represented by former White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and former NSA Chief Michael Hayden. In the opposition, journalist Glenn Greenwald, Department of Justice Attorney Thomas Tamm and a handful of NSA whistleblowers  not including Edward Snowden  cried foul over the practices of the agency. The prevailing theme of the pro-NSA side of the row is threats against the homeland, the NSA collects data from citizens foreign and domestic. Everyone is guilty until proven another domestic terrorist attack  it ignites them. from the Nixon administration. Nixon used the agency to spy on his enemies. Once caught, he tamped down its power and sent it underground. No major news came from the agency until the aftermath of 9/11. The Bush administration called upon Hayden to outline steps, necessary under the circumstances, that the agency could take in order to protect the country. Hayden successfully brought the president a plan of action that expanded the reach of his organization, a plan that collected data on friend and foe alike. What may be news to some is that in the NSA, a program called ThinThread was scrapped in order to give way to Haydens plan. ThinThread anonymized the personal information of people whom the NSA collected data on. Only when a court order was given could a suspects personal information be revealed. ThinThread was discarded because (in keeping with the NSAs argument) sweeping, legally gray action must be taken in order to protect America. One of the more rage-inducing moments of the documentary came from a standoff between Counsel Gonzales and Attorney General John Ashcroft. Ashcroft, now wary of the NSA, had to reauthorize the continuation of the NSAs practices every 45 days. When he fell ill and was rushed to the hospital hours before the NSA needed his reauthorization, Gonzales and Card, the agencys two top advocates, rushed to his bed. Though in pain, Ashcroft told the two that he would not lend them his signature. In an act of illegal proportions, Gonzales, who had no right or authority to authorize the furtherance of the NSAs practices, changed the reauthorization provision that was to be approved by the Attorney General so that it could be approved instead by Counsel Gonzales himself. And so the NSAs rich history of recklessness continued. This documentary was an abject indictment of Michael hoods and half-truths to the American public. He lied to the public when he said that there were not internal apprehensions of data collection within his agency. He misled the public when he said that the agency does not spy on Americans. He and former President George W. Bush neglected to disclose the controversial aspects of the NSA during press conferences. Keep in mind that President Obama, despite his contradictory campaign rhetoric, continued the prying. Which brings us to the present. According to the Washington Post, the administration hasnt produced one instance of NSA records preventing terrorist attacks. The best way to continue on a path of constitutional and legal irresponsibility is to make the population fearful of the most alarmist and terrifying consequences of what could happen as a result of refusing to comply with their protectors.

TUESDAY, JULY 8, 2014 ALLIGATOR, 7 Words have power. This power is the reason f**k needs to be censored. Its the reason being called a whore hurts. Its why phrases like Thats so gay, and Dont be such a f****t, are offensive. Slurs, especially gay slurs, are meant to hurt. Decades of oppression have made it so that these words were unacceptable to use. That is, until the gay community started reclaiming them. A few months ago, I wrote an article about a queer porn star for one of my classes. My professor told me I needed to use a different word than queer because its a derogatory term. I understood where he was coming from. Historically, queer has been used to degrade the gay community. But that same community has since reclaimed the word queer in past years. Oh, and also, I identify as queer. This is an umbrella term for anything outside the traditional gender and sexuality binaries. Explaining to my white-haired professor that my sexuality isnt a derogatory term was a real eye-opener. I began to notice more and more straight people tell me what I, as well as many of my gay friends, could and could not refer to myself as. Queer is offensive, so I cant say that. Dyke is offensive, too. Dont even think about calling yourself a f****t because that is Im not saying that people shouldnt point out uses of slurs and hate speech. But we run into a problem when straight people try to tell gay individuals which words they can and cannot use. The same can be said for any oppressor and oppressed group. Imagine a white person trying to correct an African-American individual on his or her use of the N-word. Its admirable that you want to stop the use of slurs, but does that make it OK to stop a group from taking back a word that was historically used to degrade it? We see this trend in pop culture, too. In 22 Jump Street, Channing Tatums character, Jenko, takes a human sexuality class and realizes that he uses gay slurs. He later blows his cover to yell at some drug dealers about their use of these same slurs. The problem with this is that Jenko isnt a representation of the LGBTQ+ community. He doesnt know what it is like to have insults like f****t thrown at him. Some gay people have reclaimed words like f****tor dyke. Just like some women call themselves sluts, despite that word having a negative connotation. Reclaiming derogatory terms, a process individual whom those slurs have been used against. It seems hypocritical, but its OK if we use those offensive words because those words have been used to hurt us, not you. But even the gay community must realize that words can only be reclaimed for oneself, not on behalf of the whole community. I can call myself queer and think of it as a positive term, but not everyone feels the same way. For example, I have a gay friend who is not offended by the word f****t, but he doesnt derogatory. Thats the whole point of slurs: Theyre offensive. Words are powerful, especially words that have been historically used to oppress a community. If you want to take a word that has been used to oppress you, like queer or f****t, and make it something positive, be my guest. But dont pin that word on other people because they might not feel the same way. So if you hear a derogatory term, dont be afraid to ask someone why he or she uses it. If its because that person is an insensitive jerk who doesnt care about the feelings of others, feel free to call his or her s**t out. But if its because that person has reclaimed your place to stop them. Robyn Smith is a UF journalism junior. Her columns appear on Tuesdays. Language, power and the politics of gay slurs Column Robyn Smithopinions@alligator.org On June 29, an older man in a red Jeep laid on his horn behind a Jimmy Johns bicycle deliverer on University Avenue. The driver sped down University around the cyclist, who was riding in the lane once the light had turned green, close enough for the cyclist to touch the Jeep. Witnesses said the driver attempted to open his door onto the cyclist, intending to push him off his bike onto the road, but the cyclist was focused on getting off of the main road. The Jeep followed him. slamming his brakes. That caused the cyclist to crash into the back of the vehicle and ricochet off another car before he fell off his bike and scraped his shoulder and back across the hot asphalt. The driver emerged from the Jeep and yelled at the cyclist but quickly silenced when he realized there were witnesses to his attempt on the cyclists life. The driver walked away with a citation, attributing his episode to road rage. The cyclist left the scene with hundreds of dollars in damage to his bike that he bought with tips from happy college students, blood on his shirt, a lost shift and a trip to the emergency room. And I got a call from the cyclist, my boyfriend of almost four years, with his steady voice telling me he had been assaulted by a vehicle but would be OK. What does OK mean? I asked. Does he have internal bleeding? How fast can I get to him? Was he breaking any laws? Then: Is he OK to ride his bike still? Will he still be able to pick me up and swing me around? Is his shoulder still strong enough to play tug-of-war with my Boston terrier, Buddy? Luckily, he really is OK. Road rage isnt an excuse for trying to kill someone. And ignorance of road rules is not an excuse for road rage. The most basic right of all vehicle operators, including bicyclists, is that they are entitled to the use of the roadway. Flbikelaw.org outlines basic statutes of cycling laws from the Florida Legislature and offers easy-to-understand translations of the legal language. Being entitled to the use of the roadway has many responsibilities, a few being cyclists and drivers must obey all hicle, there must be enough clearance, (to pass a cyclist, there must be 3 feet between you and the bicycle) and both cyclists and drivers must move with the But maybe the most relevant: Bicyclists in narrow lanes are not regardless of the presence of drivers desiring to go faster. (A) bicyclist must only is wide enough to share. A bicyclist remaining far to the right in a narrow lane is at risk of unwittingly encouraging drivers to attempt to unlawfully and unsafely pass within the lane. Gainesville is No. 37 on Bicycling. coms list of most bike-friendly cities. Keeping these statutes in mind can help make this community better and safer, but driving your more-than-4,000pound Jeep at a cyclist really just takes away from the magic of the ranking. So that cyclist who is in your way? That cyclist has the same right to be on the road as you do.

8, ALLIGATOR TUESDAY, JULY 8, 2014 STUDY JESSICA MARSHAlligator Contributing WriterAndrew Selepak, director of the online masters program in social media at UF, said his smartphone is always a reach away  a constant companion. Without the phone, Im giving up so much, Selepak said. Its not just Candy Crush. Its the most with people in the most meaningful ways. I can do so much with my phone that I cant do with my laptop. A recent survey by Bank of America Corp. said that 47 percent of Americans  just like Selepak  couldnt last more than one day without their smartphone. The survey, Bank of America Trends in Consumer Mobility Report, published on June 30, questioned 1,000 participants about their daily phone usage. Kara Watford, a 21-year-old UF health education senior, spends at Internet on her smartphone. She said she uses her phone so often because her computer sucks, and her phone accesses the Internet more quickly. The survey also said that Florida was the least likely to adopt emerging technology. Selepak said the younger a percure, the more a person is lilkey to adopt a new technology. The survey found that 79 percent of participants would give up alcohol or chocolate in order to get their phone back if it was taken unexpectedly. Mitch Schafer, a 51-year-old high school teacher from New Port Richey, Florida, attending Preview with his daughter, said he wouldnt trade anything to get his cellphone back. Id go back to my Neanderthal ways, he said. A portion of the survey results focused on the use of smartphones Regardless of how you use your phone, smartphones and other mobile technologies allow the means to communicate on a grander scale with greater ease, Selepak said.Half of Americans say they cant go a day without a smartphone THE RULING IS ON HOLD.

She has serious heart and lung problems and uses a cane, walker or scooter to get around. Taylor, for her part, was captivated by Mixners blue eyes. The two hit it off and it wasnt long before Mixner moved from her Kansas City home to join Taylor in Nampa, Idaho. They soon married in a religious ceremony during a church retreat in Oregon. When Mixner got emphysema, they made mated, then later buried with the other. They chose the veterans cemetery because they knew it would be well maintained and decided on cremation and interment in a wall.

ASSOCIATED PRESSATHENS, Ga.  Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte will resume their comebacks during a special meet at the University of Georgia this week. The Bulldog Grand Slam will feature some of the top teams in the country, including Phelps North Baltimore Aquatic Club and Lochtes SwimMAC Carolina team based in Charlotte. Phelps, who has captured a record 18 Olympic gold medals in his career, will be competing for the fourth time since coming out of retirement. Lochte is set to return to racing after having complications with his surgically repaired left knee. The meet, hosted by the Athens Bulldog Swim Club at Gabrielsen Natatorium, was hastily arranged in the past few months to give the top U.S. swimmers a chance to take part in another event this summer before the two more important competitions of the year. The national championships will be held in Irvine, California, from Aug. 6-10, followed two weeks onships in Australia. Those meets will determine the U.S. team for next years world championships in Russia. Phelps is scheduled to compete the 100 backstroke Saturday, and the 100 freestyle Sunday. Lochte has entered the same three events, as well as four other races. But it is doubtful the 11-time Olympic medalist will compete in them all coming off knee surgery late last year, especially after his initial comeback was derailed by pain and swelling. Lochte was injured in November when an exuberant teenage fan ran at him. The swimmer tried to catch her, the two fell over and Lochte hit his left knee on a curb, tearing one ligament and spraining another. He returned in April for an Arizona meet, but pushed himself a little too hard and had to sit out the season. The Athens meet will be an important test of how well Lochtes knee holds up, especially if he does the breaststroke. He has entered the 200 individual medley, which includes the breast. Phelps retired after the 2012 London Olympics, but returned to training last year. He has been steadily building his endurance through competitions and a grueling training session in the Colorado mountains. Two weeks ago at a Grand Prix meet in Santa Clara, he tied for in the 100 free and 200 free, and settled for third in the 200 IM. Lochte attended the University member of the mens swimming program under coach Gregg Troy. The former 24-time All-American tory in 12 different events by the time he graduated.
