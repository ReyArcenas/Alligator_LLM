"A big company works for me." JOHN D. EVANS, Lnliersityof Penn ylraynn.1952 "I began working on a training program for General Electric in the summer of '52. Right now. Inr 'Em-. ployee and Plant Coumm"ntY R-lattons Manager' of my company's new plant In Buirlnglton. lo"na. One of the advantages I found in working for a big coripant' such as General Electric is that. tca se of it is a;ble to give me. and other coVt gradui e ployees like me,. a wide hrit .of I rni ig and t fp-rl ence in any one, of 159 1:lav a wr the c),tr''.

That's hYJ I sy I warming tot a hg company. but a big coIMpan:. work> for me.TOO. size. 27-year-old .onn Evans is just one example of the t hausands of colegegradutesat (eneral Electric, each leting gix the opportunity for self-development so that he max grox and realize his full potential. As our nations economy continues to expand in the 1" iht-d. thousands of -oung people of leadership :.I !)tr w;ll he needed to fill new positions of responsiin American indust r-. General Electric feels that \i assuitim g young ptople like John Evans in a 1.,intIeCd progr I: of pt-a gt-owth we have found FC; a. 1 m11t. g tnts need. A Manager of Employee and Plant Community Relations at General Electric holds a responsible position: he handles employee benefits, health and safety, training, wage and salary administration, and community relations. 1-/44D ,Alignments during recent months have resulted in the creation of a political organization of 1728 committed bloc votes, os opposed to the 810 votes of the University Party. This 918 bloc vote advantage of the Gator party results in cancelling the effectiveness of 918 independent voters. In other words, 918 independent students will have to vote University Party before any uncommitted voter has a real choice in this election. The Gotor Party has been attempting to secure independent support of their bloc by creating a multitude of titles which they are offering to numbers of students who express an interest in Student Government. This principle of wide student participation in Student Government is a good one, but its use as a vote getting device should be questioned. It happens that any interested independent student who is willing to work could come to the Student Government Office and get a position-and not on the basis of a political voting committment. This has been true for the post year. We do not condemn the Gator Party just because it is big. There Is nothing basically wrong with a powerful political organization if it uses its power to present the best qualified men for ofice. However, in the present situation it seems that the Gator bloc is using this power to thwart the will of the independent student voters and to force upon them persons who are definitely lacking in the qualifications necessary for positions of responsibility in our Student Government. COMPAREMM RECORD-The University Party student government administration is now completing its first year in office. It has been one of the moit successful administration. in the history of the University of Florida. The Gator party's predecessor, the Florida Party, held office the year before and had a mediocre record in Student Government office. The University Party wants the opportunity to continue the achievements of the current administration. The programs now being developed need continuing and competent attention. The University Party's progress in traffic, finance, housing, food service and the many other student activities has bcen noteworthy. The performance has been good-the University Party wants a chance to continue. PLATFORMThe University Party platform, in essence, provides for a continuation and on improvement of this year's program. In addition, planks in the field of student discipline, student employment, and Honor Court procedure introduce new improvements in University operations. Charges that the University Party plank on telephone for the women's dormitories is not feasible are completely untrue. Conferences with the Southern Bell Telephone Company indicate that phones could be installed without breaking through walls or making any other major alterations. Several planks in the Gotor platform have already been accomplished by the University Party administration. Such Gotor proposals as giving veterans bloc seats and baby sitting service have been in effect for the entire year, and their plank bringing all student traffic violations to student court was successfully sponsored by the University Party, and was approved by the administration several weeks ago. CANDIDATES: Pres.: Dick Kerrins is the only candidate with experience in the executive and legislative branches of Student Government. His opponent, Eddie Beardsley, has not even held a position in any Student Government organization this post year. V-Pres.: Rex Harper is the only candidate with the necessary maturity and experience. His opponent, Ron McCall, has accumulated many titles, but outstanding performance has not been forthcoming. Sec.-Treas.: Eddie Heller is the only candidate with any experience in finance. He is currently Seeretary of Finance, and has a long record of achievement in Student Government finance and administration. His opponent, Bob Shaffer, is currently enrolled in ATG-211, Elementary Bookkeeping. Chancellor; Doug McMillan is the only candidate who has technical legal training as well as experience on the court. He is currently the low school justice on the court, and is chairman of the Honor Court Board of Masters. His opponent, Bob Graham, is currently a freshman class Justice, and locks the maturity and legal training necessary for this position. Clerk: Hyatt Brown' is the only candidate who has any experience on the Honor Court, as he is currently a justice on the court. His opponent, Ralph Lambert, has had no experience on the Honor Court. Lyceum Council Pres.: Riley Brice is the only candidate who has inad experience on the Lyceum Council. He is currently Lyceum Pres., an d has been on the council administration for the post two years. His opponent, Joe Bechtol, has had NO experience on Lyceum Council. Lower Slate: Of the 37 lower slate positions 'excluding freshmen and coindorsed), 25 of the University Party candidates have had previous experience on the Executive Council, Cabinet, or Honor Court. Only 12 Gator Party candidates have had any similar experience. Ii T LE ma" Jiu N C-. 4 -' F, IImk&A E A m F m I
