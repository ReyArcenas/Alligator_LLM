State officials wanted to build their own system rather than tapping into the existing one at Shands because the water there is contaminated with "sludge" he said. There is still a substantial amount more than that $3 million which would revert back to state accounts unless some unexpected expenses crop up, Kelley said. He would not give specific figure.

Former Blue Key president ousted after recent drug conviction By LI. Ua-ms Alligator Staff Writer Florida Blue Key alumni have a way of making a name for themselves. Take for example, Gov. Bob Graham, U.S. Sen. Lawton as Chiles, U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper and former Gov. Reubis Ident Askew, all members of the prestigious UF leadership honorary. But Manuel "Manny" James -president of UF Blue Key in 1969 -took a slightly different route. The 39-year-oldJameswas convicted last week for his participation in a marijuana smuggling ring -called Operation Sunburn -which prosecutors say netted $200 million and imported 600,000 pounds of pot into the southern United Statesfrom 1977to 1980. In addition to his conviction, James has another claim to faens. Last week, UF Blue Key members unanimously voted to revoke James' lifetime membership -the first time in the. organization's 59-year history a Blue Key alumnus has been booted out. see"eis neaxtg

"We picked the guy that was the best qualified regardless of price," Kelley said. After Turner Construction Co. was chosen by UF officials and approved by the Regents, Kelley said, the project was bid in about 26 different "bid packages" to different subcontractors. To save time and money, state and UF officials decided to open the subcontractor bids while the construction was underway instead of handling all 26 before the project began, UF Construction Chief C.A. O'Bryon said. That's where the savings come in. Because Notemeyer supervised everything from the drawing of the architect's plans to the bids. for subcontractors, Kelley said Notemeyer was careful to save as much as possible at every step so he could meet the promised price tag. Because the construction company had to guarantee a price to UF and state officials, Kelley said Notemeyer probably overestimated the bid a little to avoid the risk of losing money. But even so, Kelley said state officials are happy to see the comapny keeping a tight rein on costs. What state officials can count on, however, is that Turner Construction Co. is confident of having undercut its $62 million original bid by at least the $3 million, and more will probably be coming. That $3 million was reinvested in a chiller plant for the new patient services tower that will filter "sludge" out of the water system that operates throughout Shands, Kelley said. UF Facilities Planning Director Gary Koepke said UF officials know about the problem but are waiting to find a source of money before they start repairing the damage. Koepke said the amount needed for repairs is still unknown. Jamos continued from page one "We wanted to make sure the community and the state realizes our stance on this issue," said outgoing Blue Key President John Morgan. Blue Key members "don't con-_ done his actions," Morgan said. James' actions include heading the 'legal division" of the drug smuggling ring which was "set up like apy intNimtio l Corporation," according to federal prosecutor Nick Geeker. After a three-week-long trial in March, James was convicted in Panama City of "conspiracy with the intent to distribute.' James, who was the Key West city attorney at the time of his arreawaits sentencing in a Bay County jai. He could receive from five to-25 years in prison depending on the decision of U.S. District judge Lynn Higby on April 26. James graduated from UF College of Law in 1969. He was a brother at Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and a.former Interfraternity Council president. His .was also chosen for the 1969 UF Hall of Fame. "I knew he'd probably make a name. for himself somehow," said Steve Hull, Cov. Graham's press secretary. Hull and James were in the same Blue Key tapping class in the fall of 1967."He was known as a hard-nosed politician," Hull said. James was considered a -political genius" at organizing Student Government election campaigns, Hull said. "He was like a lot of students -just a real nice guy," said Eudine McLeod, -SG staff assistant. "He was a very outgoing individual, very popular." James and five others -the "upper echelon" of Operation Sunburn -were tried and convicted together. But James was acquitted of most of the charges, including organized crime and racketeering allegations because "he had a somewhat plausible excuse as to his association" with the ring; Geeker said. Throughout the trial James contended that he was "simply being an attorney" to the group and had not participated in the actual smuggling, Geeker said. "To a certain extent the jury bought that excuse and to a certain extend they did not,".he said. A four-year investigation into the smuggling ring found that James' part in the cons-piracy was more involved than he claimed, Geeker said. James and three other attorneys gave assurances to the 100-plus workers that if arrested they "would come in with bondsmen, provide representation at trials, handle Appeals and provide bonds on appeal," Geeker said. Hull said James was "always a powerful personality behind the scenes," while at UF. "Whatever he got into, he would do it with a certain vengeance and commitment." 6th Annual Israel Cultural FestiM Sunday, April4, 2:00 pem. Starting At Florida Track A 2-mile fun run.

Faculty Contract continued from poge one said representatives of both sides sent letters to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Herb Morgan, DTallahassee, in support of the salary distribution plan. But Morgan said Thursday he doesn't remember getting letters about the pay hike from anyone except State University System Chancellor Barbara Newell. Newell's letter didn't specifically state that there was a signed agreement between the two parties, but Morgan said that didn't really matter to him, anyway. "We were probably loking for that (a formal agreement), but we don't have to have that," Morgan said. House members have the power to change even a ratified agreement if they feel they don't have the money to fill the request, he said. Earlier this week, Regents Labor Relations Director Jim Parry said he knew about the settlement but understood it was only a verbal agreement, not a written pact. Included among the fringe benefit plan is a proposal that would let retired employees who have worked in a university for a least 10 years have the use of university libraries and other services. The settlement also would let retired faculty members pay for use of campus recreational facilities and parking decals, as well as giving them office space at the discretion of university officials.

The fringe benefit agreement also commits UFF officials to make a study of the cost of giving free city and campus bus passes to all faculty members, and obligates Regents officials to "consider the feasibility" of the plan once the study is finished. One such study is already in progress at UF, Snodgrass saidThe fringe benefits plan still has to come to a vote before the Regents and the UFF executive council. Naples said the plan has not been placed on the Regents agenda yet. CuT THIS oUT & MAIL To AIR NEW ORLEANS, RM. 110 ADMINISTRATION BLDG., NEW ORLEANS LAKEFRONT AIRPORT, N.O.

Tax evasion trial of Rev. Moon begins NEW YORK -The income tax evasion trial of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon opened Thursday with the prosecutor charging the controversial evangelist was not only a religious leader but a successful businessman "who deliberately cheated on his taxes." The defense for the 61-year-old Korean head of the Unification Church countered by asking, "if he wanted to defraud the government, would he walk into the Chase Manhattan bank in broad daylight and place his name on his accounts?" Defense lawyer Charles Stillman told the jury of 10 women and two men that the key issue to be decided in the case was intent. He portrayed Moon as naive about American business procedures and customs and as handicapped by language, suggesting that if there was wrongdoing it was not intentional. Moon is accused of failing to report on his 1973 to 1975 tax returns a personal income of $150,000 allegedly derived from th interest on a $1.6-million account in his name at the Chase Manhattan bank. rg ALTERNATORS, 1 ,.aNOWEN G GATOR GOLF DRIVING RANGE T GENERATORS,& STARTERSQuali,,u,,f.,,ells&,,uipmen, II ECONOMY RENTALS Pices Bring Inthisade for 4c OFF large bucket of balls I Prcs5201INW 13th St. 373-7375 18 O O~ Las .m.

4, _ __ _ _ UF Study Finds Campus ghan Ever More college students are drinking alcohol than ever before, and one-third of all students in the country are geoblem drinkers, a new study from the University of Florida reports. According to the study 08 percent of the 1020 Florido students questioned now drink, the highest ever recorded among the college-age population. About a third of those student drinkers, moreover, are "problem drinkers," the survey concluded. "The study confirms what has been an assumption for a long time," says Dr. Gerardo Gonzalez, director of the Campus Alcohol Information Center at Florida and president of the nationwide BACCHUS (Boost Alcohol Consciousness Concerning the Health of University Students). "A significant number of college students are problem drinkers, and the amount is rising all the time." Gonzalez odds the study also confirmed the impression that college students as a group drink more than other sectors of the populace.'' About 70 percent of the general population indulges, while nearly 90 percent of the campus population drinksalcohol, Gonzalez says. But Gonzalez quickly notes that most students are "responsible drinkers." "Most of the students are aware of the risks and consequences of alcohol abuse, and. they have a pretty high level of knowledge regarding the use of alcohol." Alcohol abuse among students usually shows up when a student misses classes because of hangovers, forgets what happened the night before, skips classes, attends classes while drunk, drinks alone, or incessantly drinks tothe point of intoxication. Furthermore, nearly 80 percent of all campus vandalism is related to alcohol drinking Gonzalez reports.

Video Games Become the Major College Pastme The days of ping-ponging, clitter-clottering are gone. These days the orcades of America's -college unions are more likely to resound with synthesised blasts, bleeps and zops of video games. The new games -launched just eight years ago with Atari's now primitive Pong -ore not pushing traditional union pinball machines, foosboll games and pool tables out the door, they're bringing new customers into the arcades and swelling union profits. Unions aren't hesitating to cash in on the trend. Rather than leasing or renting the games like most colleges, UCLA bought its own arcade equipment. "We train students to service the machines and supply them with all the necessary equipment," says student union DIrectorMark Panatiar. The result is that now UCLAowns 26video games. Panatier expects 1981 arcade profits to hit $311,000, up from $108,000 in 1976-77. "The game room has become so popular that we've had to limit it to students, faculty and guests," Ponatler exults. "We had kids coming in off the streets." Explaining why video games -which are actually computer programs with names like Asteroids, Space Invaders, Targ and PacMan -are so popular is-more complex than calculating their profits. In a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Amusement and Music Operators Association argued the games are popular because they provide "physical and mental exercise". Panatler says "they're just plain fun." But some sociologists fear the games foster anti-social attitudes in younger children, perhaps creating a generation that deals better with computers than with other people. Other observers s tte games as just more sophisticated pinball machines. "The games are on escapist activity, an opportunity to relax and unwind after a hard day of classes," contends David Stroud of Cinemotronics, a California game manufacturing firm. "The college players are much more sophisticated, and seem to really get into the games more." Anthropologist Dr. Edward Hall, author of Beyond Cultur. sees something subconscious in it all. "What a lot of these games are providing now is on orientation to the future," Hall claims. Students are "getting practice for the sort of things they'll have to be doing in the future. They may not know it yet, but these young people are growing up in a world we weren't born in, and they're preparing themselves for that world." "They're looked at'as games," he warns, "and they're much more than that." Arcade games aren't the only form of compus-entertaitment to be revolutionized by video. Already, colleges are beginning to replace live concerts and performances with videotaped productions. Fleetwood Mac, Paul Simon, Randy Newmand and the Pretenders are just a few of the groups now avoiloble on video for public display. "Video is turning out to be the easiest way 16 reach the largest amount of people on college campuses, simply because it con be repeat' pays Toby Silberberg, national coordinator for Films, Inc. which distributes film and videotaped productions. "Music is now the most-asked-for form of video." He estimates there are now 400-5WOcolleges using videofor entertainmentpurposes. He estimates the cost of staging a crktpus appearange for Robin Williams at "thousands of dollars." By contrast, a videotaped performance of Williams in concert rents for just $250 to $300. More campuses are catching on. Video "is just getting bigger. every day," Silberberg says. "It's happening everywhere." The only reason it's not spreading foster is the copyright low which is vague wlyen opplied to video. Legal debates over when performances con be taped, when they con be displayed and if promoters con charge admission to'view them have stalled many compus video projects, despite the efforts of record companies like Capitol, which is currently trying to rent a 55-minute tape of the tubes to colleges in lieu of a more expensive notional tour. "Right now the a on video tape are just like the sex laws in certain states," analogizes Larry Estes, feature films programs director for RCA. "What you get away with is not necessarily whale's legal." Rgir wft Looking for your first full-time job?

1% alligator, &Frday,'opel HZ1982 -, Gators vIsit Vat crucial 4asebal ser ies Ailgfofe StaffWriter just as the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division baseball race is heating up, the two top teams -UF and the University of Tennessee -face off in a weekend series in Knoxville with the division lead at stake. The two teams play a Saturday afternoon doubleheader beginning at 1, and finish the series with a 1 Ip.m. encounter Sunday. The Gators hold a half-game lead over the Volunteers in the East with a third of the SEC slate completed. UF is 6-1-1 in conference games, while Tennessee has a 6-2 record. The Gators hold a four-year lock on the East crown. Volunteer coach Don Whited said, "there's not a whole lot of difference between this year and the last couple. Florida is still the team to beat. The standings indicate that." There has been a difference, though, in the Vols. Tennessee 4L. has resurfaced as conference title contenders after floundering to a 10-13 SEC record in 1981. Whited describes his team as "not great, but balanced." He returns six of nine starters in the field, and has recruited heavily to shore up last year's weak spot -pitching. 'Whoever wins this series is going to have the inside track on taking the division. If we don't win it, we're not out of it, but if we do win it, it gives us that much more of a lead.' -Jack Rhine "They're not scared of playing the Gators," said UF coach Jack Rhine. "Right now, they're putting the hitting and pitching together, so they're a lot more consistent than these have been." But the Gators also have been combining those two aspects of the game successfully in recent games. Gator bats have been surprisingly strong, and after some shaky outings, the pitching staff proved unbeatable during the past week. UF's three starters this weekend Rich Bombard, Nick Krsnich and George Rees, are all coming off complete-gaime wins. Visiting Hudson Field is not Rhine's idea of a perfect weekend, he said. He labels the Vols' home one of several SEC parks with substandard facilities. But since the Gators' tasy -111nI9j~ tuefield has leen resodded a ti se fuce movd ba~t20 fe to jihe seith the. Vols'deemphasis onpdwer-hitting. "Whoever wins this series is going to have the inside track on taking the division," Rhine said. "If we don't win it, we're not out of it, but if we do win it, it gives us that much more of a lead. This is just the first of three or four crucial series." UF hosts Georgia, FSU in trnmeet on Saturday By Bill Word Alligator Staff Writer It seems like the UF track team can't get a rest. Just last weekend the Gators, whose key people still have some injuries, competed in their own Florida Relays and this ,Saturday they have a tri-meet with two of 'he South's big track'powers -the University of Georgia and Florida State University. The meet begins at 1 p.m. at Percy B0rd Track and admission is free. If those two teams don't present enough problems for the Gators, injuries do. The Gators go into the meet with eight key athletes injured, and head coach John Randolph says his team has had to change philosophies about its next few meets. "We've had to make a long-term decision about our outdoor season," said Randolph. "We're coming into the meet undefeated in dual and three-way meets since the indoor season but with all these injuries, our goals are going to have to be in May and not now." Thoseinjured include sprinters Creighton Blahak, and Roger Dixon, middle-distance men Lester Mattox, Mike Lindses, field men Tanner Cronic and Neil Serafenas and distance runner Marty Beauchamp. "I haven't seen anything like this in my 15 years ol coaching," Randolph said. "Those are front-line people." As usual, Georgia wil lbe sending Herschel Walker to the meet, but this time with a different twist to the NCAA AllAmerica running back. Not only will Walker he flashing his speed in the 100 meters (10.1), the sophomore will be showing a little muscle try competing for the first time in the shot put. FSU will be sending NCAA All-Americas Herbie Wills and Rol Gomez along with speedster Donnie Frost, (FSU punter) Rohn Stark and Doug Overfelt. Wills is one of the nation's best distance runners, Gomez had earned NCAA All-America status in the 1,000 meters, Frost is one of the South's top 100 meter men and Overfelt is a 3,000 meter steeplechase standout. Lady Gator tracksters host UG. In dual meet "Ny MldsusTrunftw Afligator Writer The Lady Gator track team will host the University of Georgia in its first outdoor dual meet of the season Saturday at Percy Beard Track. UF handed the Bulklogs a 50-33 drubbing in the O'Connell Center in January, but head coach Carol Slowik said they should fare better outdoors. "They have kids running now that were injured during indoors," Slowik said. "They'll be a much better rounded team than we saw in January, especially in the middle distances. But we should do well in this meet. The girls are ready for the outdoor season, and I think that will show this Saturday." The Lady Gators elected to pass up the Bulldog Babe Invitational last weekend in Athens, Ga., in. favor of more training. "We're trying to avoid getting stale performances toward the end of the season from too much competition," Slowik said. UF will be boosted by the return of Cross-Country AllAmerican Shelly Steely and former Florida high school 100yard and 200-yard sprint champ Eunice Ashford. Both were plagued by injuries during the indoor season, but Slowik said they have been progressing well and should be hitting their stride soon. Softball team travels to Alabama tourney The Lady Gator softball team travels to the Montgomery, Alabama Tournament this weekend, possibly facing rival Florida State University before the double elimination tourney ends Sunday. The 12-team field includes squads from University of South Florida, University of Mississippi and Auburn University. "There will be a lot of teams from Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama -that we haven't seen a lot of, but that are in our region," said UF softball coach Frances Cox. UF, 29-8, is coming off Tuesday's 3-0 win over Jacksonville University, and a 14-0 victory over the Lady Seminoles. Cox said the Lady Gators must get some solid hitting to be successful this weekend. "Even though we beat FSU 14-0, we only got eight hits," the coach explained. "That probably wouldn't have been enough to beat FSU if they had been hitting too." FSU managed just two hits, while UF took advantage of sevenLady Seminole errors for the win.
