A Study of OurLags By JOHN SULLIVAN (C-3 Writing Laboratory) E \'EIY()NE ha;s a large vocabulary of slang, but viulga' expressions are more numerous and "'vOrked thati those of the cultu-# 1. Its content em divided ito two categories: old words that have". plit to new uses, and new words that have not yet :ntc'(eptud by society. The use of "rubberneck," for a ing ltt't'son, and "iceberg," for a cold woman, at* miples of the first; examples of the second are gow11 aid 'iblah." There is, however, a constant lient of slang terms into accepted usage. Such :1s t'o hold up," or "to fly off he hanti',' are generally used today where once they were sneer-i ;t a.-; slang. All new words, or course, are not slang. When the word "rodeo,'m erived from theSpanish, tamo into th e standard vocabtlary it was accepted at once becaulsu' it designated something for which there was no other word in English. Other words .such as "kodak" and "vaseline" have been the inventions of quite .rosrnen. Slang, as it has once been said, is the product of mental activity, an0 tne natural delight of lanuage-inakng. Some of the best stang "merges from the argot of college students. It is actuallV mrade by the campus wit-s, just etai slang is made by the iinis of the newspapers and thea ters Featured columnist writ-r'. like Walter Winchell, have -itfl-d.terms such as "infantici1-ieting" and stockedd" for those xp'ting young: 'renovated" for Oivoii-ted, and -'shafts' for legs. The sports writers, likewise, are il great makers of slang. With tihe possible exceptior4 of the French, the Americanm now P'Oduce7. morc slang than any other people, and put to heaver use in their daily affairs. It started in this country out West, following the great westward movement after the War of 1812. It suoon penetrated to the East and, bY 18-10 slang was very widespread. To those days before the Civil War wtowe many of the colorful tten-ms for strong drink sna-h as "panther-sweat," "coffinvarnish," and "tonsil-paint;" and for, drunk: 'boiled," -stewed," "annei.' -"pie-eyed, tanked." anI "pifflie ted." lng originates from the effort of imIgenious individuals to rmake the language more pungent and expressive. The maker of slang isnot bound by any rules and is ftret' to use any materiajA he chooses. is words enrich language and provide new words for everyday -concepts.
