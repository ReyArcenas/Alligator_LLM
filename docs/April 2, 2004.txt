UF makes the grade By CLAIRE MITCHELL Alligator Writer cmitchell@alligator.org U.S. News & World Report published its list of top graduate schools, and all in all UF has moved up in the rankings. "Moving two spots in one year should be deemed very favorably, since these things have a lot of inertia in them," law professor Joe Little said of the Levin College of Law's move from 45th in 2003 to the 43rd spot this year. "This college of law has. everything to offer that any college of law in the country has," Little said. "It's very hard to make any big changes in a short period of time." The College of Education advanced from 26th to 24th, while the College of Engineering remained at 26th, and the College of Medicine came in at 40th. The only exception was the Warrington College of Business Administration, which plummeted from 27th to 53rd. Dean of Engineering Pramod Khargonekar said the ranking is important for his school. "We certainly have a very strong graduate program, a very strong faculty who excel in scholarship and original research." Pramod Khargonekar Dean of Engineering "Graduate students pay attention to these rankings," he said. "When it comes to recruiting faculty, it can also play a role." Khargonekar said though he is happy about maintaining last year's rank he is more excited about the engineering college's jump in rankings among public schools -from 16th to 14th. "We certainly have a very strong graduate program, a very strong faculty who excel in scholarship and original research," he said. "They also work very hard to secure external research funding." Though UF is most competitive with other public schools, Khargonekar said UF's program does compete with private schools. "When I think about the future of the college, we do worry about competition from private universities," he said. "We do compete for the students and for the faculty.

By LINDSAY DOWNEY Alligator Writer Idowney@alligator.org Two UF Interfratenity Council chapters next week will face hearings with the Greek Judicial Board stemming from allegations of underage drinking at their fraternity houses. On March 4, four underage students reportedly were cited for alcohol consumption at a Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity party, in which one student was transported to Shands Hospital, according to documents released by the Dean of Students Office. Two female students, one holding an open can of beer and the other an open cup, and a fraternity brother with a bottle of rum in his pocket were stopped by University Police officers and asked for identification, according the police report. While none of the students -whose names cannot be released -could produce identification, record checks confirmed they were under 21. As an officer completed paperwork for the three students, a third underage female was stopped at the door. "She was very disoriented and appeared that she may lose consciousness. She needed assistance standing up," the police report stated. An ambulance was dispatched, and the woman was transported to Shands.

4, ALLIGATO1It tRDAY, APRIL, 2664 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT Bush signs fetus safeguard law THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WASHINGTON .Accompanied by grieving families, President Bush on Thursday signed into law new protections for the unborn that for the first time make it a separate federal crime to harm a fetus during an assault on the mother. "If the crime is murder and the unborn child's life ends, justice demands a full accounting under the law," Bush said before signing the measure, a major priority for many of the president's most loyal political supporters. "The suffering of two victims can never equal only one offense." Abortion-rights proponents, meanwhile, called the measure an assault on reproductive freedom because it represents the first recognition of federal legal rights for an embryo or fetus as a person separate from the woman. An exuberant audience of abortion foes cheered the president during his remarks, while a few of the family members who shared the East Room stage wiped away tears. Included in the group were the mother and stepfather of California murder victim Laci Peterson, who was eight months pregnant when she died December 2002. Bush devoted a large share of his speech to the loss of "a beautiful young woman who was joyfully awaiting the arrival of a new son." But the new law wouldn't apply to crimes such as that in the Peterson case. It applies only to harm to a fetus while a federal crime, such as a terrorist attack or drug-related shooting, is being committed against the pregnant mother. The legislation defines an "unborn child" as a child in utero at "any stage of development." More than two dozen states have similar laws, including California where Peterson's husband, Scott, is being tried on double murder charges and could face the death penalty if convicted. rablo marnes Monsivals / Ar Pnoto President Bush signs the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington on Thursday.

6, ALLIGATOR d FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 2004 Editorial We can't sleep anymore. With all the excitement of having a new addition to the Department, our eyes have barely shut in the past week. The joys of parenting are many: the late-night whining, the potty training and the chewed up socks. Yes, we at the Department of Darts & Laurels have fallen deep in puppy love. See, professor Smith, it really was the dog that ate our response paper. Our little bundle of... energy already has changed our lives. In just a short time, we've perfected the fine art of tug-ofwar, and we finally understand the thrill of paying $8.50 for a squeaky, stuffed rhino. We know exactly how many sheets of paper towels it takes to clean up the accidents, and we've gone through more boxes of rubber gloves than we'd care to admit. Why can't they just make diapers for these leaky little demons? But we have used our new doggie to our advantage several times already. It appears cute puppies are instant magnets for even cuter girls and guys. That's all well and good, except when these puppy lovers feel the need to get the animal instincts riled up, only to escape just when the energy is reaching a fever pitch. Thanks a lot. We really wanted to spend that half-hour after you left "walking the dog." So eat all your din-din, stay out of the trash and try not to slobber all over this week's edition of... Darts & Laurels As we try to wiggle out of our spiked collar, we wipe a that's-about-as-effective-as-chasing-your-tail DART for the students who didn't vote in this week's mayoral runoff. Only 100 of several thousand registered students voted in the Reitz Union on Tuesday, making Dance Dance Revolution a more popular spot than the polls. We've learned that treats are good incentives for getting puppies to do things you want, like roll over or not take a dump on the floor. Maybe poll clerks should try a simliar tactic to entice UF students to fulfill their civic duty. As we search the pet store for puppy Listerine, we fetch a you're-barking-up-the-right-tree LAUREL to members of the InterFraternity Council, who took up the project of painting the 34th Street wall in memory of the victims of Danny Rolling's student murders. Gainesville Police Department Capt. Sadie Darnell, who maintained the wall, ended the project after the 10-year anniversary, but IFC will continue to pay tribute to the five victims by keeping the memorial intact. This act of generosity almost makes us want to cuddle up with the boys and rub their beer bellies. Almost. Clawing at the sofa cushions, we nuzzle Usher with a yourbark-is-much-sweeter-than-your-bite LAUREL for finally knocking Norah Jones off the top of the Billboard chart. The cuddly crooner's new release, Confessions, replaced Jones' overhyped, underinspired sophomore album, which enjoyed an inexplicable seven-week stay at the top of the chart. We would rather listen to our puppy whining all night than endure another poorly written ballad by the girl who has gone downhill fast since her first release made us believe in jazz vocalists again. Usher, who has single-handedly returned pelvic thrust to prominence, has thankfully put Jones in her place and us out of our misery. Jones can give us all the puppy dog eyes she wants, but her album still sucked. It was time for that bitch to take a walk. And now, if you'll excuse us, it's time for our bitch to do the same. .Qthe independentflorida alligator Cameron Ackroyd Sarah Anderson EDITOR OPINIONS EDITOR Laura Merritt Claudia Adrien, Warren Kagarise MANAGING EDITOR Nick Weidenmiller EDITORIAL BOARD The Alligator encourage comments from readers.

The party he represents uses an ass as its mascot, and Kerry himself occasionally acts like one -such as when he cursed at a Secret Service agent who accidentally knocked him over.

What matters is that he's not some old money Yalie. Whoops. What makes Kerry so attractive is who he is not.

After all, Al Gore received more votes ever than anybody except Ronald Reagan. By default, Kerry is the ABB point man. He is the left's blue knight in shining armor, and he'll ride into Boston on a golden donkey this summer. It would be impossible to label Kerry as the perfect Democrat -or George W. Bush as the perfect Republican -but at least Kerry doesn't currently live at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. That's enough for the angry Dems. Even if Kerry doesn't get anyone too excited, the reasoning goes, he's better than his old college classmate. The Dems rallied last week, throwing a Unity Day bash with Kerry's former rivals to emphasize the weakness of Bush's resume rather than the strength of Kerry's.

So far, Kerry has dropped the F-bomb in a Rolling Stone interview and been photographed snowboarding in Sun Valley. He has the makings of coolness. He doesn't need to worry about getting slapped with the Big Lib stigma; he was born with it. I love it when people attach the word "liberal" to Kerry and bandy it around like it's obscene. Bush is a conservative. It's the reason we have two parties. If Kerry gets elected, I don't foresee anything remotely as exciting to watch as the rodeo that is the Bush White House. Forget the type of staunchly partisan agenda America have grown to love, too. For four years or eight, Kerry would be keeping the seat warm for a third Bush term or a third Clinton term before melting into history. So far, this particularly ugly campaign has kept the nation's voters awake. After all, the president is more of an elephant man.

FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 2004Un ALLIGATOR, 7 Letters to the Editor Gator fans freak over Alligator fake news Editor: Evil, pure evil. Stumbling back from an early morning class Thursday, the first words out of my mouth after reading the Alligator's headline were "Oh God!" Happy thoughts of returning to a comfy bed were immediately ripped from my psyche as my brain feverishly worked to envision the dire implications that Leak's departure would have on the Gator Nation. As I read on in shock, I kept wondering why "SportsCenter" hadn't mentioned the horrible details. A $1,500 signing bonus? Some copy editor must have screwed up on that -one, more like $150,000 -wait a minute. What day is Past April Fools' Day editions have been flavored by fake stories of a most improbable nature -Godzilla attacking campus and a brick falling off century tower and injuring a virgin. I can't recall any being this creative, clever, convincing and downright mean. And I'm sure I wasn't the only chump, at least momentarily, suckered in. As I returned home, I passed two students engaged in an expletive-filled discussion revolving around the Gator's chances next year and the shortsightedness of Leak's decision. I didn't let them in on the truth. I had plans of my own underway -showing the article relating the tragic "news" to my still sleeping roommate.

(8, KL:LIGTORWFkIDkYAMkI I 2; 2ob4 Local man jailed in29 child pornography counts POLICE SAY MAN GAVE LEWD PHOTOS TO CHILD. By JUSTIN NHEMLEPP Alligator Staff Writer jhemlepp@alligator.org Arrested on Thursday for 29 counts of child pornography, a Gainesville resident awaits trial, facing a $2.9 million bond and up to 145 years in prison. William Ted Sherrod, 39, is charged of giving a computer disk containing lewd pictures of prepubescent children -the youngest 3 years old -to a minor, Alachua Sheriff's Office spokesman Keith Faulk said. The child's mother then turned the disk over to detectives, he said. The mother and child will not be identified because of the ongoing investigation and sexual nature of the reported crime, Faulk said. He added officials hope to prosecute Sherrod without the child's testimony. "The evidence will speak for itself once it is shown," he said. Faulk said neither Sherrod nor the child was depicted in the pornographic material, and investigators are pursuing the identities of the children portrayed being molested in the pictures, he said. "We have identified that each of the pictures is of a real child," he said, noting the photos were not enhanced. Detectives have been working on this case for several weeks, Faulk said. But he indicated the investigation into Sherrod has "just begun." Authorities acting on multiple search warrants have seized at least two computers belonging to Sherrod, along with disks and zip disks, Faulk said. The items are being examined for evidence of more illegal pornography or signs of its erasure. Furthercharges are pending in the case, Faulk said, declining to specify their nature because of the investigation. "He (Sherrod) has implicated himself in the charge," Faulk referring to the 29 charges Sher now faces.t.

Students move clock forward to end Spring semester Daylight saving time begins on Sunday By COLBY HILLIS Alligator Contributing Writer You may not know when, why or for how long, but starting this weekend it's gone, and it's not coming back until the fall. The clocks will spring forward, and at 2 a.m. on Sunday one hour will disappear. Some people are aware they will be losing an hour of sleep, though many do not know why they are pushing their clocks forward or that they would be doing it this weekend. Dave Wirth, a criminology senior, said he wasn't positive if the clocks changed this weekend or not. "I heard something on Cartoon Network about it, but other than that I didn't know," he said. Even if some know the clocks change this weekend, not all know why or when the tradition started. Wirth said the time changes because the sun rises and sets at different times. He said he thought it started with farmers a while ago. Meghan Rusbridge, a business junior, said she heard a similar story from her parents. "They said something about farmers not having enough time to farm and be with their families so they needed more daylight," she said. "I know that's not it." Rachael Semenick said because she is an agriculture major she should know why daylight saving time is used but admitted she had no idea how it started or when. "Yearwise I have no idea," Semenick said. "I've heard it before. I think this is a Trivial Pursuit question." These people may not know the history of daylight-saving time, but they do know which part of the year is their favorite. "Which one means I can sleep more?" asked Wirth. "That's the one I like." According to the California Energy Commission's Web site, Benjamin Franklin "They said something about farm ers not having enough time to farm and be with their families s they needed more daylight. I kno that's not it." Meghan Rusbrldg UFjunic first had the idea of moving the clocks in orde to conserve energy. During World War I, th idea was adopted by Congress in 1918.

A 49-year-old man was arrested Wednesday after police say he threatened to cut the throat of a woman at the J. Hillis Miller Health Center. Angel M. Miller, 28, was walking with her husband Arnold Miller when she bumped into the man in the center's atrium, University Police spokesman Joe Sharkey said. Upon the accidental contact, Allen C. Starke reportedly said, "Go your punk-ass on, or I will cut your throat." Though Starke never brandished his weapon, witnesses reported to police he pointed to his fanny pack, indicating the knife was inside. Reports show that while Arnold Miller confronted Starke, Angel Miller notified a nurse of the situation. Police then apprehended the suspect without further incident, Sharkey said. Starke is charged in aggravated assault, and no injuries were reported, he said. DEPUTIES TO ACCOMPANY SPRING BREAKERS: Alachua County's middle and high school students vacationing for Spring Break in St. Augustine will see some familiar badges on the beaches. Beginning Saturday, 13 School Resource deputies and three sergeants will be assigned to assist the St. John's County Sheriff's Office with an expected influx of students and their families to the area until April 10. The program, in its 10th year, assists St. John's authorities with loud parties, underage drinking, noises, disturbances and other typical law enforcement duties, said Alachua County Sheriff's Office spokesman Keith Faulk, noting, "It's no day at the beach for our people." "These young adults have been known to get into a little mischief, and we know there's some underage drinking" Faulk said. "Our deputies will know, more often than not, the student." -JUSTIN HEMLEPP Florida players take center stage at new arts center N THE PLAYERS HAVE TEAMED WITH P.K. YONGE.

The school just opened the P.K. Yonge Performing Arts Center, and the Florida Players is one of the first groups to use the stage. "When we first approached P.K. Yonge about using their space, they kind of made a deal," Deitsch said. "'If you help our students out, then you guys can use our stage."' The group showed the P.K.

Nelson Abreu Science of Self Club president Conventional scientific research and unconventional ideas will be fused in an attempt to explain the unexplained, said Nelson Abreu, president of the Science of Self Club, who is hosting the event. -"We feel that giving a stage for serious scientific research on nonconventional topics is essential because scientific journals are censoring this type of work," he said. Gainesville residents Russell Donda and Andrew Nichols will begin the event with a lecture in Room 101 of the New Engineering Building tonight. Donda, whose lecture begins at 6 p.m., is a "thinker" who believes quantum physical reality is akin to the paranormal. Nichols will give a lecture at 7:45 p.m. on "Ghosts, Electromagnetics and Altered States," based on his investigations of 600 cases of ghosts and his studies on telepathy, precognition and paranormal dreams. According to the Web site http://www.southernghosts.com, Nicholas has appeared on several television shows about the paranormal, including "Unsolved Mysteries" and the Discovery Channel's "Real Ghosthunters." Abreu, a UF senior, said he dream. hopes the conference will e people to try to induce al states of consciousness on own.

f'RLAAPK4L'24tX.04 P*LIGAIO~Rl'1 Rice to testify Thursday 0 THE TOP BUSH ADVISOR WILL GIVE TESTIMONY TO THE 9/11 COMMISSION. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WASHINGTON -National security adviser Condoleezza Rice will go before the Sept. 11 commission next Thursday in an effort to counter criticism that the Bush administration failed to grasp the gravity of the terrorism threat before the Sept. 11, 2001 hijackings. The commission will hear only from Rice during a 2 1/2-hour public session focusing on what Clinton administration officials told the incoming Bush White House about al-Qaida and what the new administration did with the information. "We really want to find out about the transition, what they learned and what changes in policy the Bush administration decided and what focus there was on terrorism," the commission chairman, Thomas Kean, said in an interview. But on Thursday, Bruce Lindsey, Clinton's legal representative for records and a longtime confidant, told The Associated Press that the commission isn't getting the full picture of former President Clinton's terrorism policies because the Bush administration has turned over only 25 percent of the 11,000 records requested. The White House says it fully met the commission's information requests. "Whether documents from the Clinton administration or the Bush administration, we have worked to ensure the commission has all the information it needs to get its job done," said Taylor Gross, a White House spokesman. When Rice testifies, her performance could have enormous implications for President Bush's re-election campaign. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke testified last week that the administration did not consider al-Qaida an urgent threat, despite his repeated warnings. "We really want to find out about the transition, what they learned and what changes in policy the Bush administration decided and what focus there was on terrorism." Thomas Kean commission chairman The White House, citing legal concerns, had stood fast in saying Rice would only meet privately with the commission. After mounting pressure, the White House relented this week after assurances that the appearance of.a senior presidential adviser would not set a precedent applicable to other congressionally appointed panels. In other developments Thursday, the White House released fragments of a top-secret document, finalized Sept. 4, 2001, that directed the Pentagon to draw up plans for attacking al-Qaida and the Taliban. Greek community will hear cases GREEK, from page 1 drank half a bottle of vodka with the fraternity member who invited her to the date function and does not remember events after 10:30 p.m. In another organization allegation, UPD officers arrived at Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity on Feb. 10, responding to a complaint that beer cans were being thrown at passing vehicles. While officers found no evidence of the complaint, they did cite three underage students for drinking. Two members of the fraternity were stopped, one for slurred speech and stumbling, who said he had not been drinking at the fraternity house, and the other for a flask of Jim Beam in his pocket, according to DSO documents. A 19-year-old sorority member, who presented UPD with her driver's license, also was cited for drinking underage. While the fraternity did require wristbands for students to be served alcohol, in a Feb. 20 SJA interview the woman said she did not present a fake I.D. but was handed a wristband at the door and ordered beers from the bartender. Officers also reported two pans of Jell-O shots in the house's courtyard. Both fraternity presidents shut down the parties at the request of UPD. Pi Kappa Phi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon both are being charged with violating the Alcoholic Beverage Rule and the Academic Honesty Guidelines Rule. In addition, Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity is charged with violating a rule that concerns ',actions which are committed with disregard of the possible harm to an individual or group," for the female who was transported to Shands. Four IFC Judicial Board members and two board members from other Greek councils will hear the cases next week, said Cyrus Williams, director for Williams Student Judicial Affairs and assistant dean. "The Greek community is going to give them their hearing -not us, not the administration,"' Williams said. "Thieir peers decide if they're responsible or not and, if they are responsible, what sanctions they should receive." IFC Executive Vice* President Charles Appleby will preside over the hearings, and Williams will oversee the process. Fraternity presidents could not be reached for comment Thursday evening.

"The undergraduate program is rigorous, and most of those students move on to the grad school," said Fernandez, who has already logged classroom time assisting at five area schools. "It's nice to know the school's getting some recognition." Despite the popularity of the U.S. News rankings, professors say the system is not necessarily representative of a program. "These rankings can be criticized for not being completely reflective in the kind of work going on the quality of the university," Khargonekar said. WE DELIVER! sn" The criteria for ranKing mclUIvidual schools vary, but peer and recruiter assessment, average graduate school entrance test scores, acceptance rate, research expenditures, grants received and graduate degrees given are considered when assessing most schools. "I quarrel with a lot of the basis of the ranking system," Little con1983 He said many in the law school faculty would argue the quality of education at 43rd-ranked UF compares with schools much closer to the top of the U.S. News list. "That doesn't take away from the assessment that the new ranking says some good things about the institution," Little said. GAINESVILLE 2220 S.W. ARCHER RD. 271.7600 1724 W.

FRIDAY, APRIL 2004 a ALLIGATOR, 21 BASEBALL Victory against FSU spurs Gators against Georgia By LOUIS ANASTASIS Alligator Writer lanastasis@aIligator.org Rivalry week continues in Gainesville. The UF baseball team (25-5, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) follows the thrills of a Florida State victory with a three-game series against Georgia (16-10, 24 SEC), with the series kicking off this evening. The Gators enter the matchup on a six-game winning streak. However, the Bulldogs have been moving in the opposite direction, losing their previous six games. Hoping to take advantage of a Georgia team batting only .243 during the skid, UF starts junior Justin Hoyman (6-0). The ace of UF's pitching staff maintains a cautious approach toward the faulty Georgia lineup. "You can think about that two different ways," said Hoyman, who leads the SEC in wins, strikeouts and innings pitched. "You can say, 'Yeah, those guys are struggl;-.,; and I'm going to stick it to them,' or 'Hey, you .guys are struggling, and you're going to be able to break out."' The Gators experienced a 14-game winning streak earlier during the season, but their latest run could carry more weight. After taking two of three from Arkansas two weeks ago, UF defeated Dartmouth, swept a road series against Kentucky and rallied in extra innings to defeat the 10th-ranked Seminoles. Whether the Gators face the best teams or the worst teams, Hoyman uses the same philosophy. "They're all the same to me; I hate them all," Hoyman said. Two Gators' players are besting their team's run ofvictories with a streak of their own. Entering tonight's game, center fielder Jeff Corsaletti boasts a 12-game hitting streak, while shortstop Justin Tordi trails closely with an 11-game streak. The key to-both players' newfound success appears to be experience. Corsaletti said that last year he was overly aggressive at theplate, a technique that resulted in few walks. Tordi seems to have gone through similar growing pains and with nearly identical results. "Justin Tordi last year and Justin Tordi this year are two different people," Corsaletti said. "Last year, he was a free swinger, and this year he's improved so much and he's unbelievable." In Wednesday's home game against the Seminoles, UF set a McKethan Stadium attendance record 5,663. Achieving similar results against Georgia might be far-fetched, but regardless, Corsaletti insists on giving supporters a personal message. "Even if you only want to come out for a little bit; come out," he said. "I guarantee you're going to have a good time watching the game." SEC showdown could propel No. 13 UF N A SERIES VICTORY AGAINST GEORGIA COULD PUT THE GATORS AMONG THE NATION'S ELITE. By BRYAN APP Alligator Contributing Writer Top-10 teams beware. The Gators are on the rise and poised to take a spot. The No. 13 UF softball team will face what could be its toughest opponent of the season so far with Southeastern Conference leader Georgia coming into the Florida Softball Stadium for a three-game series during the weekend. A UF series victory would likely propel the Gators into the top 10 for the first time in school history. After defeating No. 22 Auburn for their first conference-series sweep of the season on Wednesday, second-place UF finds itself in a three-way race with Georgia and Tennessee for the top spot in the SEC East. The No. 5 Bulldogs (33-6, 10-2 SEC) will bring a seven-game winning streak into Saturday's doubleheader and are coming off a 4-1 win against in-state rival Georgia Tech. "They are a very well-rounded team," UF Coach Karen Johns said of Georgia. "There isn't one area they are so good at because they're so good at everything." The Gators will have to account for powerful Georgia hitters such as Kim Wendland, who is hitting .475 with eight home runs, 56 RBIs and a .814 slugging percentage. Ashley Godfrey and her seven homers of the season will also present a challenge to UE A major variable in a possible UF series win could be the health of top starter Jenny Gladding (174). Gladding, who is also the team's home-run leader with four on the season, did not play in Wednesday's 11-3 rout of Auburn due to a minor injury that the team describes as "midseason bumps and bruises." Johns said the decision to sit Gladding hinged Gladding mainly on the desire to rest the senior in preparation for Georgia. UF pitchers Stacy Stevens, Amanda Moore and Amanda Knowles proved they could get the job done for the Gators by combining for Who: Georgia at UF First pitch: 6:30 p.m. Where: McKethan Stadium Tickets: Available.

While UF is 16-3 against right-handed pitchers, Georgia will start left-hander Paul Lubrano.1 nto top-lO five strikeouts and giving up eight hits in the six-inning mercy-rule win versus the Tigers. "We knew as a team we had to win without Jenny," Johns said. "We told them this was their chance, and they all came through." But against such a prolific offensive team as Georgia, with a combined .345 batting average, 210 RBIs and 33 home runs; the Gators could miss Gladding's .79 ERA and 215 strikeouts in the event that she sees additional rest time. If the UF offense gets a repeat performance from Mandy Schuerman, Michelle Diaz, Lacy Howard and Kristen Butler, who combind for six of the team's 11 hits on Wednesday, there could be a new SEC leader come Sunday. "The Gators are definitely on the rise," Butler said. "We are ready for anyone this year. -We're not scared."

22, ALLIGATORS1!IMDAY, AMRL 2/20041-4 Dickey plays ironman, Zook goes fooling FOOTBALL, from page 24 win against Florida State? Wit~two full practices on Thursday. Dickey returned to the football field after practicing with the baseball team earlier in the day, rating his performance as subpar. "It wasn't my best practice today, but I learned a lot," Dickey said. "It's crazy. I threw a little after baseball practice and then came over here. At football practice I was finc at the beginning, and then it started to wear on me at the end of practice." Dickey came out determined to iake up for lost practice time but had little success. After throwing two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns he admitted that the switch from baseball to football practice is difficult and mentally straining. "It's hard to flip the switch like that," he said. "I just try to stay as focused as possible, get more from the mental part of the game then, say, the physical part." A popular figure in both locker rooms, Dickey had the support of his baseball team who cheered from the sidelines. While his baseball teammates didn't witness one of Dickey 9 finer moments, he was appreciative that they even bothered to show up. "That's really big that the guys came over," Dickey said. "They watched me play football after they finished baseball practice, and that means a lot to me." WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND: In response to the Alligator's April Fool's Day hoax regarding UF quarterback Chris Leak, Coach Ron Zook pulled a stunt of-his own. Alligator football writers were excluded from speaking with members of the team and Zook himself following UF's practice on Thursday. After refusing to begin his daily interview session with the media until all Alligator writers had exited the group, Zook looked Zook around and quietly said, "April Fools." He then went on with business as usual, but as he walked into the Swamp's south end zone tunnel, Zook glanced back at the Alligator staff with a grin and a thumbs up. The mock front page of Thursday's Alligator contained a photograph of Leak with a story stating that the quarterback had plans to leave UF and play instead for NFL Europe's Frankfurt Galaxy. -ANDREW ABRAMSON, BRIAN SHAFFER II Young gymnasts shine in spotlight GYM, from page 24 Arkansas, Illinois or Illinois-Chicago, so they are going into the meet with confidence. "We're going to go in there and try to be as clean as possible and make as few mistakes as possible," Coach Rhonda Faehn said. "I feel that when we do that, there is no question we're going to advance to nationals." The two highest-scoring teams in this region will advance to the NCAA Championships, held April 15-17 in Los Angeles. UF barely made it last year, edging North Carolina by a tenth of a point. Stucky tied for the beam title at the NCAA Regionals last year and scored the only 10 on beam in UF history this season, showing how valuable she is. Although she will not be competing, her teammates are glad she will be coming along to Arizona. "It means the world to us," Szmuch said. "She is the toughest athlete I've ever known. To have her by our side is such an inspiration, and it should be an inspiration to every athlete out there." When Stucky went down, IJF's team got even younger. Freshman Samantha Lutz took over on beam, and sophomore Sherie Owens was the Gators' replacement on bars. Although UF used 14 freshmen routines at the Southeastern Conference Championships, Faehn is not worried about its lack of NCAA experience. "[The freshmen] are prepared, they're ready," Faehn said. "They've been under much more difficult pressure situations than regionals. SEC's are way more pressure than I would say even the Super Six." The Gators head into the, meet coming off the first weekend they've had off this season, so they'll be well rested. "It was wonderful for the athletes to be able to have a break thids last weekend," Faehn said. "This week they've trained really hard and we are definitely ready to go."

THROWING DOMINANCE Corps leads Gators through By MATTHEW RUIZ "Go Candice!" they scream. Alligator Contributing Writer "Come on, Kim!" The entire team chants her on as she sets, glides and The shouts of the teammates are hurls the shot 50 feet into the throwunmistakable. ing area. "Nice throw, Karen!" Nick West / Alligator 51 Despite adjusting to a deep throwers team and the magnitude NCAAs, Akera Lathan has turned in notable throws of her own. I iout season You would expect to hear these sounds from parents at a tee-ball game, but they're coming from AllAmerican athletes in contention for national titles...at practice. But for the UF women's throws team, that kind of teamwork, camaraderie and support is what makes them into championship-caliber athletes in the first place. "I think working together and being around such talented people has really brought out the best in all of us," Junior Karen Freberg said. And their best has certainly been something to behold. The girls have long met and surpassed their expectations, which were lofty to begin with. According to Associate Head Coach Larry Judge, this is the thirdconsecutive year in which UF has swept the Southeastern Conference -by far the toughest conference in the nation -1-2-3 in the weight throw and the fourth-consecutive year UF has had the SEC champion in the weight throw. They also have four 55-foot shot putters, a NCAA record, and took the top-five spots at the SEC Outdoor Championships last spring. Not to mention the last three national championships in the indoor weight throw, two for Candice Scott and one for former Gator Erin Gilreath. The championships and accolades didn't come overnight, however, and certainly didn't come without plenty -of long hours and hard work. And right there, the entire time, was Judge. A Coach and a System Since coming to the Gators as the Associate Head Coach and throws coach in 2000, Judge has been named both Master Coach (2002) and Assistant Throws Coach of the Year (2003) by United States Track & Field. Judge has written more than 30 articles on track and field technique, nutrition and resistance training. He is a certified personal trainer, fitness instructor and strength and conditioning coach. Bottom line -when coach Judge talks, his athletes listen. And they reap the benefits. Sitting on a set of bleachers next to Percy Beard track on a windy day before practice, Judge sits behind his signature mirrored Oakley sunglasses and talks about how he is able to get so much out of these girls. "What I've done is show them a system, and it's a system that's worked very well," Judge said. "And the girls have bought into the system. They believe in it." "I think working together and being around such talented people has really brought out the best in all of us." Karen Freberg UF track and field thrower Judge's system has gained a reputation as successful, and athletes have begun to respond to his successes as a coach. All-American and Minnesota native Rachel Longfors cites her reasons for coming to UF as, "team atmosphere, and the coach's ability to coach track and field." Shining Stars Even with a stellar coach, the onus remains on the athletes, who ultimately must perform, no matter how much tutelage they have received. Plenty of practice and a dedicated work ethic drive the women to succeed.-Their typical practice day, as described by All-American and NCAA weight throw runner-up Barrett, is gruling. This daily practice regimen is usually complemented by a 5 a.m. wake up call on meet days, usually for a "shake-out" according to AllAmerican Jukina Dickerson. Despite the harsh training regimen, it is the team atmosphere that drives them to succeed. "I was the only shot putter at [Southern Methodist University]," transfer Freberg said. "And right now, being around the best throwers in the nation has really been a positive atmosphere." With so many stars sharing the same roster, one might wonder if some of the girls would be happier on a less successful team in a smaller I --FREE Dental Screening (Board Patient Services) Must be at least 18 years old and not pregnant NEED EXTRA SUMMER FUN MONEY?

"I like the way our team is set up," co-captain Dickerson said. "We push each other. We puih the conference, and being that this is the toughest conference, it pushes us." Not that they need any pushing, especially Barrett, who likes her space. It would not be smart to test how much Barrett likes her space, as her primal screams during competition let everyone in attendance know when it's her turn. "When I know I have to get it done, I'll do it without any cheerleaders or nagging," Barrett said. With such an intensive training schedule and high standards set for themselves, it would seerA as if there's no room for fun, but the girls manage. "I joke a lot around those close to me," said Dickerson. "I'm really goofy." Looking Ahead The future looks bright for the Gators, who will return all but two of their throwers next season, including weight throw national champion Scott and runner-up Barrett. Even. freshman Akera Lathan caught a hint of the championship fever, qualifying for the NCAAs in the shot put and placing 11th. When asked what it was like to be try*ning for nationals as a freshman, lathan simply said, "It's a learning experience." After a NCAA indoor competition that saw the throwers score 31 of UF's 51 points in its second-place finish, the throwers will look to carry the team to.its first-ever outdoor national championship. And of course, wasting no time; they started things off on the right foot, earning the top-three spots in the shot put and earning the top collegiate mark in the weight throw at the Florida Relays last weekend. But no matter what the rest of outdoor season holds for the throwers, each athlete can be sure of one thing: there will be a teammate right behind them. w w

I -I ALLIGATOR www.alligator.org/sports FRIDAY. APRIL 2.2004 GYMNASTICS UF to use injury as motivation By IAN FISHER Alligator Writer ifisher@alligator.org DB Brown vying to fill Ratliff's shoes V' When the Gators' regular season rolls around, one member of what will be a revamped UF secondary could have a familiar name to fans of the team. However, Vernell Brown might not be the player Gator Nation thinks of when wondering about UF's replacement for All-American cornerback Keiwan Ratliff. Brown, who was originally recruited as a defensive back, has moved from wide receiver to the defensive backfield and has quickly moved up the depth chart. He now works with the second-team defense during spring practices. "Me moving to defensive back was ~ind of a last minute decision," he said. "But I'm getting back into it out here. I'm just looking forward to the season and trying to do everything I can to try to be a great defensive back." While he still must watch sophomore Dee Webb and senior Reynaldo Hill work with the first-team defense at the cornerback spots, Brown has his sights set on bigger things than a backup position. "My role right now is to compete for a startingposition along with all of the othegreat cornerbacks we have out here," he said. "Basically, I'll see the way things turn out when the fall gets here." DOUBLE DUTY: -It was a thrilling 7-6 comeMatt Marriott/Alligator Staff from-behind victory that Gavin Dickey UF Coach Ron Zook has seen Vernell Brown transition from wide receiver to cornersaid he won't soon forget -so how did the back and has been pleased with the results. Zook now has Brown playing with the baseball outfielder celebrate Wednesday's second-team defense at practice. SEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 22 SEE GYM, PAGE 22 JUMPBALL Writers argue game's oldest debate: pitching wins or does hitting? Editor's Note: This is tMe sixth of a series of Friday debate cclumns between two of the Alligator's sports columnists. To tell us who made the most convincing argument, log on to alligator.org and cast your i. vote. The Gators are hot right now, and theyshould credit their production from the plate more than their work from the mound. With four regular players batting .360 or better, the Gators depend more on their bats than their arms. Jeff Corsaletti, Justin Tordi, C.J. Smith and Ben Harrison are the Gators' primary hitting staff. It was Harrison's hit and eventual run that defeated Florida State on Wednesday, and that's been the recipe for the majority of the Gators' 25 victories this season. It has become evident the Gators rely more on outscoring opponents than out-pitching them. The Gators are allowing 5.1 runs per game but are bringing home 8.6; their bats are afire, and just in time, as the Southeastern schedule is set to heat up. Many, of the Oscar Ubilus Gators' bats have The Grouch Potato been hot recently. oubillus@alligator.org Coach Pat McMahon and his No. 13 Gators don't have to lean on one or two sluggers. McMahon has witnessed a slew of consistent hitters, with the RBI and home runs spread out. While baseball games always begin with a first pitch, the Gators seem to be winning because they start their games with a first "ding." or all of you caught up in spring football or still recovering from a hoops hangover, pay close attention to the baseball team and quick. The Gators are going places and a huge part of the success can be credited to a deadly pitching staff. Look no further than Justin Hoyman, but do it soon because this hurler is too good to stay at UF past this season. The Southeastern Conference leader in innings pitched, strikeouts and wins, Hoyman is feared by teams across the conference and is an ace pitcher who will be counted on to win key games come playoff time. Connor Falkenbach can be credited for shutting down the Seminoles in Wednesday's 7-6 victory against rival FSU. Possibly the Gators' most important ingredient on a daily basis, Falkenbach has appeared in more games than any pitcher in the SEC. His Andrew5 1/3 shutout Abramson innings against Drew's Control FSU might have aabramson@alligator.org been the biggest moment in his career to date, and he refused to crack under the pressure. Sophomore Bryan Ball and junior Tommy Boss continue to improve in an already proven rotation.
