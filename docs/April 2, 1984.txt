9.l T?1,Z thbe rejection khr boases o a higher pay Plan. City and plie union officials have been emnbroiled in a wage dispute since last spring when. negotiations began, with city officials essentially responding that their tight budget would not allow them to increasepolice officers' salaries. As one of Gainesville's finest pointed out with his sign while picketing last week, "It's criminal what cops get pa d." But this is a crime loal officials can and must take action againuit o wipe out-now. Dave Howard, president of the Communication Workers of America local chapter, said Gainesville police officers take home paychecks that are ridiculously low. -The average cop gets about $l6,00Q a year, he s5idQf12 ities In: o1orida with a comparable population, Gainesville police salaries rank 11th. City commissioners refused to paytGliesvlle police the increase they requested even though a state arbitrator recommended the pay plan be implemented, which would mean auqthr $100,000 for police salaries. Frank Forbes, the city's personnel chief, said the arbitrator's suggestion was rejected because the pay raise would "break good faith with other unions representing city employees who have already settled for a 3.5 percent increase." Police union officials argue against this thrifty sentiment by citing higher pay increases .-for management and futile spending by commissioners on such projects as the downtown clock, which cost about $60,000. All they're asking for is an average pay increase of about 28 cents, Howard said. Right now, the main'disagreement lies between paying more to senior officers. Union officials believe senior officers, who have "topped out" and can't get pay increases now, deserve a 5 percent pay increase on top of the other suggested increases. After all, Howard said, some of these senior officers-haven't received a pay increase -.otherthan cost of living increases. -for five, or six years. One union official pointed out what many are thinking: "The priorities in this town stink." And, even more importantly, the city's priorities are slewed when one consider that commissioners always cite fighting crime as their main objective. But this cannot be done with an overworked and disgruntled police corps. Granted, the newly enacted 4-10 work plan should alleviate some of the stress and overworked complaints police officershave. This four-day work plan will have cops working four days a week for 10 hours with three days off. One police officer said the new work schedule is expected to boost morae and pu more officers on the street. But, as Howard points out, unless.poice officers also can count ontheir paycheck being boosted, the city will have even more serious problems.

"We have 47 House members andtwo senators. There are lots of bills that have flown with les."

That will be tough, he said, because of what he calls "thefear factor" -"It has beenmy experience that the IRS ignores (tax dressing) as long as possible," Lehman said. "They, might just stick you in a file and forget about you, depending on how much youowe." Lehman withheld $70 last year, and now he's on the IRS's mailing list, but so far, no collector has called him, he said. "It's when you get into the high bucks they come after you."

Lehman was asked by Jackie, a tax resister who would not give her full name. "This is my'second year of withholding 64 t," Jackie said.

Synergetics Inc., on South Main Street, was cited by the DER for dumping hazardous wastes into a nearby pond, which showed signs of being an untreated industrial waste discharge., DEI ground water specialist Cathy Farmer said the Jacksonville branch of her agency had sent a letter to Synergetics on March 14, giving the company guidelines on how to test its water. Farmer said the company was told to respond within 30 days. Farmer said the company had complied with all the requirements, including sending a list of all the materials the company had ever used. That list was necessary before DER officials could tell Synergetics what to test for. For that reason, the company was given an extension last week on the original order to test its water within 45 days. She said Synergetics officials were told to perform four differettests. The first test would check primary and secondary drinking water standards, Farmer said. The company was also told to do a volatile organic carbon scan and to check for keytone, a classof organic compoqods. These products, along with cyanide, were found in products used at the plant. Synergetics manufactures parts for computer axial tomography scanner systems and has five plants in Alachua County. A M M U.
