Gainesville voters don't know yet who will represent them, but, they do know who won't take the reins of city government in May. -Amid a tense crowd of family and supporters at the Supervisor of Elections headquarters Tuesday night, the eight candidates for Gainesville's two open City Commission seats were pared down to four, with the races for districts 2 and 3 to be decided by run-off elections. In District 2, incumbent John Barrow and SFCC educator Ed Braddy will compete in the April 16 runoff. Retired educator Tony Domenech and former Mayor-Commissioner Mark Goldstein will continue in the District 3 race.

White did not admit to the abuse, but said his actions were misinterpreted, seminary president Stephen Bosso said Monday. In an interview with the South florida Sun-Sentinel, White said he knewhis past might eventually be revealed. Kevin Mahoney, 42, of Salem, Ore., said White abused him for three years, beginning when he was a senior -at Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, N.Y. Mahoney said the priest later presided over his wedding and his sister's funeral. Mahoney said White became a friend of his family and inappropriately touched him as a teen about 20 times during overnight stays.

Doctors at North Ridge Medical Center, where May received 11 stitches, said the bite appeared to come from a shark. .1 thought at first it was probably a jellyfish," May said at a news conference, wearing a large bandage on his left arm above the elbow. "Then I saw there was blood in the water and bloodrunning down my arm, and I realized it was serious." George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, said it was the fifth Florida shark attack this year. He told the South Florida Sun-Sentinelthat the incident was typical of Florida shark attacks -a quick bite, a release and an injury that was not life threatening.

w Mf#SDAY, APRIL 3, 2002 UP to fire f former transplant director *SHANDS EMPLOYEE WILL STAY SIX MONTHS BEFORE UF DOES NOT RENEW HIS CONTRACT. ByJoe Black Alligator Staff Writer jblack@alligator.org The former leader of Shands HealthCare organ transplant program, who recently came under fire and was relieved of duties, will be given six more months before UF terminates his employment. A HealthCare spokeswoman said a letter was drafted Tuesday saying LifeQuest executive director Charles McCluskey will stay on within the College of Medicine's surgery department until Oct. 4, but his contract will not be renewed. "During the remainder of your employment with UF you will be reassigned to other duties and responsibilities consistent with your professional experience to best meet the needs of the department of surgery in the College of Medicine," spokeswoman Arline Phillips-Han said the letter stated. The document was not released to the public. McCluskey recently was relieved of his duties as leader of the program because an internal audit found he had knowledge of an employee's possible conflict of interest with a for-profit facility. He denies the allegations, but could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. The internal reports come after years of McCluskey being rated highly by his employers and receiving high pay increases. However, at the announcement of McCluskey's LifeQuest firing, Howard said, "We hold all individuals accountable for their behavior. If they do not meet expectations, then those individuals are terminated." Recent reports found director of Recovery Services Jose Cardo's family members may have owned and operated the Florida Research Foundation, and his home may have been its principle place of operation. About 15 organs may have one to the research foundation ast year. Organs unsuitable for human transplant often are sent to research organizations or universities. Cardo could not be reached for comment. "During previous discussions with the executive director of LifeQuest, my request for an educational leave of absence was discouraged," he wrote in a recent letter to Shands Transplant Center medical director Richard Howard. "Therefore, my decision to resign is based on my desire to pursue educational and professional goals." Howard wrote back that he accepted Cardo's letter and said UF does not waive any rights to readdress the situation, which is under review. Danielle Cornell has been named LifeQuest interim executive director. She had been beaten out for Cardo's position because she "had only minimum qualifications and slight organ procurement experience," according to employment records. 4 N Jordan Fischer /i wsa, Sowing seeds Dolly Yong prepares her parcel of land at the Student Agricultural Gardens for new seeds Tuesday afternoon.

"I'm nervous as a devil," he said. "In truth, I'm stunned." Domenech said his 30 percent showing proved voters were receptive to his message that the city must become friendlier to business owners. "We need to be thinking beyond our noses and toward helping others, and the only way to do that is to bring in jobs," he said. Goldstein, who had a narrow lead with 31 percent, said he looks forward to the runoff. "I'm ready," he said. "I think I have a worthy opponent." He added that his and Domenech's strong showing in spite of having smaller campaign contributions than Alex Patton, the top fundraiser, said a lot about city politics. "He who had the most got the least," he said. "Big money is the opposite of big success in Gainesville." Patton raised nearly $25,000, but received only 18 percent of the vote. Nevertheless, he had a strong showing of support as he worked his way through a sea of T-shirted supporters. More than 15 UF students crowded around Patton to support their candidate to the end.

, ALLIGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 3,2002 jjjindelulen kjnrid amgaor Founded in 1906 Independent since 1973 We Inform. You Decide. Jenny L. Allen Editor Jason Brown Mark Ward Editorial Board EDITORIALS I want my MP3s The golden days of free, downloadable music on the Internet soon might be a distant memory, with MP3 players joining 8-Tracs on the scrap heap of useless tech. U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., introduced legislation that would deal a deathblow to music and movie piracy on the Internet. Unfortunately, the draconian nature of the measure also targets consumers who use their personal computers to download and copy music and movie files from the Web. The bill, called the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act (the CBDTPA for all you laymen out there), would prohibit the sale or distribution of any kind of electronic device that doesn't include copy-protection standards to be set by the federal government, via the Federal Communications Commission, at a latter date. Any hardware or software that reproduces, displays or "retrieves or accesses" any kind of copyrighted work would be subject to the law. Violating the act would result in statutory damages ranging from $200 to $25,000 per violation and possible jail time. Embraced by both the music industry and Hollywood, the legislation is an all-out attack on copying that would murder the burgeoning MP3-player industry. Tech-heads are hollering, as code programmers and software firms will be forced to embed copy-protection schemes in all their software, even if it was distributed for free. With Napster in the trash and its progeny fighting off lawsuits and legislation, the future of online music is indeed murky. Have we been misled? Isn't it our God-given right as Americans to download and burn Pink Floyd songs? And porn! Yes. Despite the fears of a cabal of techno-phobic old men, online music will live on. The Internet is, by definition, a forum for the free exchange of information. The genie has been let out of the bottle, and even the government hasn't the means to stuff his ass back in. Fiscal juggling act The federal government pulled a move akin to one made by many college students when their bills are due, moving debt balances from one credit card to another to stay afloat financially. The Bush administration this week announced plans to place federal retirement funds into a non-interest-bearing account, giving the U.S. Treasury the ability to borrow the money it will need in coming weeks to keep the government operating. Without the transferring of funds, the government would have been unable to pay interest on the national debt, technically defaulting on the $5.95 trillion charge our nation has racked up. Missing the payments would not only pose a threat to the stability of U.S. securities, the safest investment in the world, but it would force the government to pay higher interest payments on the national debt in future years, resulting in billions of dollars paid out with no benefits. Political wrangling is at the heart of this financial tightrope walk. The move was made because Congress couldn't pass a measure that would have increased the limit the government could borrow. Democrats wish to send a message to the president that last years' tax cut was too vast and has pushed the country back into deficit spending. Republicans counter saying the tax cut was needed to lift the country out of recession. In this time of economic downturn, our leaders need to come together and practice fiscal responsibility instead of dabbling in financial hocus-pocus. The ALLIGATOR encourages comments from readers.

GUEST COLUMN Musicians should be about music (U-WIRE) NORMAN, Okla. -Perusing the racks at my local magazine shop revealed a disturbing turn of events. Tiffany, one-time teen pop queen and current has-been, has attempted to jump-start her career with a nude pictorial in Playboy magazine. No matter your thoughts on her body of work (I mean her music, silly) this recent career change from singer/performer to piece of meat is at best disheartening. After all, shouldn't Tiffany's upcoming new album be judged on its own merit, and not in conjunction with her new bare-all publicity tactics? In this day and age -of course not. Let's face it. Music today has less to do with individual credibility than at any other time in the history of music. Not since the days of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin have good looks and an ability to sing been stretched so far. Performers looking to make it big need a visual catch to sell their music. Maybe it's taking off all your clothes and parading your 30-year-old butt across the pages of a nudie magazine, but whatever the trick, it better be bigger than the one that came before you. Of course, music stars only do ridiculous things because we let them. For proof I turn to VH 1, who has recently unearthed a long lost work of art called "Cool as Ice." This blockbuster stars Vanilla Ice and set some record for the fastest on-screen to video switch in motion picture history. I think it took seven minutes. Whatever the case, the fact that VH 1 has decided to begin showing this awful film, in its entirety, is only slightly worse than the fact that they are showing it often, which means people are watching it. The views expressed here are not TUESDAY'S QUESTION Should Goy. Jeb Bush be re-elected as governor of Florida? YES NO. 46% 54% 2213 total votes That's right. It's our fault for watching the movie, and it's our fault for reading Playboy, and one day it will be our fault for funded* Britney Spears' door-to-door whore routine. we want music, we should support musician If we want movies, we should support actors.( we want naked women, we should fund the, HILTON PRICE U-WIRE proper magazines. Putting all these different professions in one person may be easy on our decision-makin& but bad for the overall quality. Sure, a Britney who sings, acts and stripsfs command may satisfy our entertain.,e* needs and fulfill some slightly disturbin g C* nal desires, but wouldn't it be better to bu 1 good CD, see a quality movie and get arealliV date? I think so. So, although the red-blooded male in me never complains about nudity, and-th-" cheesy-movie fan always likes a good bomb, 1] have to ask my music stars to leave these out-J lets alone. Sure, Tiffany may have held up well over her 30 years, and Vanilla Ice is actually really funny when he's trying to act tough, but I'd -prefer to judge these people on their music merit. It will get them into my garbage and out ef my sight a lot faster, and keep other media outlets free from their fame-obsessed filth. Hilton Price is a student at the University of Oklahoma.

12, AIUIGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 3, 2002 Bush urged to name Cuban ATTORNEYY GENERAL SUGGESTS BUSH SHOULD APPOINT FIRST HISPANIC TO STATE SUPREME COURT. The Amdcled Press TALLAHASSEE -Gov. Jeb Bush soon will have his first chance to appoint a state Supreme Court justice, and Attorney General Bob Butterworth is suggesting he use it to name the first Hispanic to the high court. Hispanics make up 16.8 percent of the state's population, making them Florida's largest minority group, yet a Hispanic has never served as a Supreme Court justice. The first black justice, Joseph Hatchett, was appointed.in 1975. The first woman, Rosemary Barkett, was appointed in 1985. "This would be an excellent opportun-t ... to place a Hispanic on the court, Butterworth said. But Bush, who is running for re-election in November, said Tuesday that it's "way too early" to begin discussing whom should replace Justice Major Harding when he retires Aug. 31. That's not stopping Butterworth from recommending that Bush consider Roberto Martinez, a Cuban-born, Miami-area lawyer and former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida. It's a name Bush is familiar with -the Republican lawyer was on the governor's transition team after Bush was elected in 1998. "This will be a really important opportunity for the governor," Butterworth, a Democrat, said Monday. "The person he appoints will speak a lot about this governor. It will be an opportunity to define his governorship." After his election in 1998, but before his inauguration, Bush joined his predecessor, the late Gov. Lawton Chiles, in choosing Justice Peggy Quince, now one of two black justices and two women seated on the seven-member court. Each of the state's five appellate districts already is represented by a justice, meaning Bush will be able to choose Harding's replacement from anywhere in the state. The governor must appoint a new justice from at least three and up to six nominees named by the Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission. Martinez, who specializes in criminal defense, served as U.S. attorney from 1992 to 1993. He was an assistant in the federal prosecutor's office from 1982 to 1987. Martinez was in a meeting Tuesday afternoon and not available for comment. Cancer diagnosis, later for women in poverty The Asodated Pres WASHINGTON -Poor women are less likely to be diagnosed and treated for breast cancer, and more likely to die from it, according to a study that searched for reasons why fewer black women survive the disease than whites. Other studies have shown that black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer at a late disease stage and to have a shorter survival time than white womep, but it has not been clear if this is because of race or poverty. Cathy J. Bradley of Michigan State University said the new study shows that a lower socio-economic status is more important than race in determining the quality of medical care for women with breast cancer. "Poor persons, regardless of their race, are likely to have undesirable cancer outcomes," said Bradley and her co-authors in a study appearing Wednesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Bradley said the researchers used the Detroit cancer registry to identify 5,719 women with breast canr. e searched the registry for womM breast cancer who also werelued rolls of Medicaid. They found 5 93 cancer patients in Medicaid and comes below the federal poverty The researchers then compared medical outcome of the patients Medicaid with those who were not. Bradley said they found that Medicaid were 41 percent more be diagnosed with breast cancer at a stage and were 44 percent less likely t ceive radiation. Women on Medicaid were three times more likely to die of4 disease than were non-Medicaid pa The poor outcome of the Medicadi tients suggests they are not rec ivIng1 routine medical care that might cmi breast cancer to be discovered at an ei lier, more treatable stage, said Bradley "If you don't have a regular source:. care prior to that diagnosis, you are ma likely to be at a late stage of the diseai when treatment starts, Bradley said.

WAY, FRUARY 26, 2o00DZ ONI Championship causes -disruption COML, PARK Md. -Pepper spray, tear gas, mounted police and riot ear didn't deter a melee of Marynd fans from assaultin police, looting stores and startingbonfires on the campus and in downtown College Park on Monday night. Police were taunted repeatedly by fans who mooned them, pranced in front of them and slowly surrounded them from all sides. -, Police were told to wait until they judged the situation as unsafe for celebrators before they moved into the thousand-wide crowd to disperse fans, said Col. David Mitchell, superintendent for the Maryland State Police. When they did move in on the crowd, fans climbed a tree and broke off large branches to hurl at about 20 officers on horseback and a line of riot-gear clothed police, in addition to the bottles, glass and trash they were already throwing. There were about a half dozen arrests and no major injuries to students or police said Mitchell. Police, fire and emergency radio reported about 20 injuries Monday anid at least three to police. A Prince George's County Police officer was transported to the hospital with minor injuries after being hit in the back with a brick. I University Police were not able to quell three separate bonfires on Fraternity Row, but stood ready to make arii rests should any of the about 4,000 fans become violent on the campus. All in all, it went as we expected," said Col. Michael McNair, deputy chief of the University Police Department. The police's strategy was to let the students be, McNair said. "We don't want to instigate anything. There are enough problems there, we don't need to make it more crowded.' -The Diamondback Unruly crowds continue at Indiana BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -After Indiana's loss to Maryland, crowds on Kirkwood Avenue set T-shirts and trees on fire and tore down street lights, street signs and trees. Police dispersed the unruly crowd with the release of tear gas, sending students running through campus. Students dashed through Dunn Meadow with their hands to their faces, covering their eyes at about 1:25 a.m. Two state troopers were hit with bottles, one with such force it cracked his gas mask. Another trooper was hit with a bottle on his left leg after the tear gas was dispersed. The Bloomington Fire Department wrapped the wound, which was bleeding considerably. "The idea was to let kids to come out and have a good time, but unfortunately a few itidijiduma dedded to throw beer bottles at police," said Lt. Ed Reuter. "At one point weere-bombarded-with 40 to 50 beer bottles.Alumnus Becky Carnegy saidshe was hit with tear gas. She said-she had been notifying the police of damage to a window, when without warning she felt her eyes tear up and her throat get scratchy. "I don't know why the police did that,w she said. "But what would you do if you were in charge of that? College kids shouldn't be throwing stuff at police, but honestly, what are they supposed to do?' At 1:45 a.m., police scanner traffic indicated a second round of tear gas to the crowd. The scanner also said the city had run out of ambulances and fire trucks to respond to other calls. -The Indiana Daily Student New Mexico signs hoops coach ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -In 1996, Ritchie McKay started his coaching career by nearly upsetting the University of Mississippi, led by then-coach Rob Evans. The Rebels would defeat McKay's Portland State team 56-54 on a controversial, last-second shot by Chris Olney, which the Vikings argued was released after the buzzer sounded. On Thursday night, McKay scored his revenge. In another controversial decision involving the two coaches, the outvos no t'PN.0 tatfa 1 NewXexico: But New Mexico Ale Rudy Davalos coteabheliever fered the job to him. .Nevertheless,. McKay became the I8th head coach in UNM history, succeeding Fran Fraschilla, who resigned after tree seasons and no NCAA Tournament appearances. McKay was announced as the new coach late Thursday night after reports that Arizona State a coach Rob Evans was offered the job. The headlines from television stations and newspapers Friday morning may have left confused looks on the faces of many Lobo fans, but a telephone press conference later in the day left no doubt that McKay was the choice. "It is certainly an exciting time for my family and I to be privileged enough to have the opportunity that we've ben afforded to coach at UNM, McKay said. "The process was a little grueling in terms of having to have left a program and a school that we've only been there for two years.' New Mexico will buy out McKay's contact with Oregon State for $225,000. The University also has to pay former coach Fran Fraschilla about $500,000 after buying out his contract, -which had two years left. -The Daily Lobs U I ~ ~ uiuIurIra~,Iiaiai,,~mriau r1 ~.

Baseball circus begins season with sideshows Strange days are upon us. In Cincinnati, Ohio, a cow was given the key to the city but was left out of the Findlay Market Opening Day parade for being unruly before the game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs. "Cinci Freedom" escaped from a meatpacking plant and hid in a Cincinnati park for 10 days. Yeah, a half-ton mammal eluded Cincinnati officials for more than a week. The city that brought us Mayor Jerry Springer and Marge Schott has police that were outwitted by a cow. Then a pop artist adopted the cow for his farm sanctuary in upstate New York. I just don't want to see her freak out," the artist said. "She'll be there with her mrlfriends and her buddies, and she'll va happy life." Thank God for the Reds. They're the oAly saving grace of that city -until Memorial Day when they're out of the'playoff race -in these times where farm animals outfox the police. That's right, baseball season has started, and with the Final Four out of the way and the hockey season running what seems to be a month too long, the summer pastime is back. Three days old, actually, with plenty of incidents to go around. First of all, the Yankees are mortal. Sure they signed the best pure hitter in the game injason Giambi, but they suffered a loss before the season started. New York fans will have to settle on 20 televised games a season with Cablevision refusing to add the Yankees television network to its basic lineup until George Steinbrenner pulls off the miraculous midseason trade where he acqtires a TV network and yet another ace. And DerekJeter is short a glove and bat. Which brings us to Ruben Rivera. The Texas Rangers are a sideshow. Carl EverettJohn Rocker and now Rivera (ona minor league contract) -a bad attitude, a racist and a thief.

The Jacksonville native heard stories about the Bulldogs' coach from his high school coach, Bob West, and pitching coach -Dave McMahon. But Starkville, Miss., was too far for Rumble, and instead he made the move to Gainesville. That coach Rumble has heard about was his pitching coach's brother, Pat McMahon -a graduate and former coach at Bishop Kenny. '1 knew Pat McMahon had a real good team at Mississippi State," Rumble said. "I knew Bishop Kenny was a gateway to Mississippi State. I felt a little pressure to go there. Everything we heard about McMahon was good." Instead of Rumble heading west to McMahon, McMahon came to Rumble in Gainesville. When Rumble recovers from elbow surgery, he will have the chance to play for McMahon, who replaced former UF coach Andy Lopez in June. McMahon will make his first appearance in Jacksonville in a Gators uniform today as the UF baseball team (24-6) faces the Dolphins at Alexander Brest Field. It will be the first time he has seen .Jacksonville University (14-15) since 1990, when the Dolphins defeated McMahon's Old Dominion team in the Regionals. "It is really special, growing up in Jacksonville," said McMahon, Who. coached Bishop Kenny from 1977-1980 io a 95.25 record.

Before Purdue, Peck spent one season as an assistant at Kentucky during the 1995-96 season and two years at Tennessee (1993-95) under Coach Pat Summitt. The Volunteers posted a 65-5 record during that time, won two Southeastern Conference championships and reached the 1995 national title game. Peck played at Vanderbilt from -1985-88. The 6-foot-4 center averaged 10.6 *points and 5.8 rebounds with 180 blocked shots ove rthe course of her collegiate career. She was the team captain in her junior and senior seasons at Vanderbilt. Peck played professional ball for the Nippondenso Corporation in Japan from 1991-93. Ross, who resigned March 22 after 12 seasons,, said she felt it would take a new coach to help the Gators advance deeper into the NCAA Tournament. Ross left UF with a 247-121 career record, leading the Gators to the NCAA Tournament nine out of the last 10 years. This season, the Gators lost in the first round of the NCAA ,Tournament to Brigham Young, 90-52. The Gators farthest advancement in the Tournament was in 1997, when Ross led the Gators to the Elite Eight. [ returns to roots for game sonville. Many of Bishop Kenny's players, like Rumble, wanted to become Bulldogs. Two Bishop Kenny graduates were on his first team at Mississippi State,, and 13 Florida natives were on his Bulldogs teams from 1997-2001.

In a baseball-mad town where even an opening-day loss sparks whispers of doom, those numbers can add up to a lost season for fans accustomed to seeing their team fail. More important than the sta' cs were the sights of Mons 12-11 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays -Martinez firing 84 pitches with his rehabilitated right shoulder, Garciaparra throwing out a batter from deep in the shortstop hole with his surgically repaired wrist and Varitek sliding to catch a foul ball not far from where a similar catch shattered his right elbow. Three of Boston's best players say they're feeling fine after missing much of last season, when the Red Sox faded in Aut then finished 13 games bethe New York Yankees in the American League East and missed the playoffs. All three never played together last season. And Monday's opener was the. first time Manny Ramirez, Garciaparra, Martinez and Varitek -perhaps Boston's four most valuable players -appeared in the same game for the Red Sox. They had a chance to rest Tuesday, when both teams were idle before Wednesday night's series finale. Afte catching all three ofMartinez's shaky innings, Vartek gave an upbeat assessment of himself and the staff ace. "It's a good test, and I feel strong. I have to continue to get stronger," he said. And the possessor of three Cy Young Awards? "As long as he's healthy and he feels good, his pitches will come," Varitek said. But in the ninth, Toronto pulled off a double steal against reliever Ugueth Urbina that led to Darrin Fletcher's winning sacrifice fly. Last season, Boston struggled trying to stop steals. Varitek said he called for a fastball, and Urbina threw a slider but "I don't know if we woul've gottheminu y' Last June 6, Varitek broke his. elbow. divinnrthe on-deck. drcle fora pop byShaneHail-, ter of Detroit.

Garciaparra, the AL batting champion in 1999 and 2000, had wrist surgery on opening day last season, April 2, and returned to play only 21 games before tendinitis forced him to end his season on Aug. 26.
