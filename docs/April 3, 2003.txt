the independent florida 'A Cli nton's visit draws variety of spectators By Aptil Simpson Alligator Writer asimpson alligator.org Democrat or Republican, Green orLibertarian, students of all political ideologes plan to hear former president William': Jefferson Clinton speak this afternoon at the O'Connell Center. Accent, Student Government's speaker's bureau, is sponsoring the event, which is free and open to the public. Doors open at 3 p.m. Eric Trabin, Accent director, said he's expecting people from Tallahassee, West Palmo Beach and Daytona to attend. "I'm sure we'll have representatives from all around our state," he said. Between five and 10 Beaches Democratic Club members are planning to make the two-hour trip from Jacksonville-area beaches to hear the former president. Gabe Farra, who is on the club's board of directors, said he last saw Clinton when he visited the area in 2000 to campaign for former presidential candidate Al Gore. mi think that there are a lot of strong followers of Clinton here and a lot of people who still wish he was still president," Farra said, while adding that he is one of them. Anne Pizatto, College Republicans chairwoman, said her org izatio R to meet in front of Gate One of the O'Connell Center with 20 to 30 members wearing navy-blue "best party on campus" T-shirts. She said her organization's members aren't thrilled about Clinton's arrival because they didn't agree with his policies while in office, however, they will not protest in response out of respect for the former president. "At least we didn't pay more for Clinton than we did for Bush," she said, while adding that that would have caused a major problem. Accent hosted former president George H.W. Bush in'Jan. 2001. "He knew that Saddam had been harboring weapons of mass destruction from the 1990s A war," Pizatto said. "Yet when he was in office, he never did a thing about it. So I feel that the Bush administration is cleaning up a lot of [Clinton's] policies."

ACROSS THE STATE House panel pushing move to July for primary TALLAHASSEE (AP) Florida voters could be at the polls on one of the hottest days of summer under a measure approved Wednesday by a House committee that also favored reinstating the runoff election voided in the 2002 election. For those voters not on summer vacation in 2004, the Florida primary would be held July 20 with the runoff Sept. 7 and the General Election Nov. 2. The dates approved by the House Procedures Committee were designed to give the state's elections supervisors adequate time to print new ballots and mail overseas ballots to the military. "It really doesn't affect us that much," state elections supervisor Ed Kast said. "The impact is mostly at the county level The primary election has traditionally been scheduled on the Tuesday following Labor Day in the first week of September. Kast said the midsummer primary shouldn't be a prob1em. "With early voting and absentee and how convenient it is to vote, people should be coming out," he said. Several of Florida's leading elected officials in recent years have benefited from the second primary, or runoff election. Govs. Reubin Askew and Bob Graham each finished second in a Democratic primary before winning runoffs and then the general elec-tion as did Lawton Chiles when he first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1970 as a little-known, central Florida state lawmaker. A second primary is necessary only if one candidate didn't get at least 50 percent of the vote, which happens only when there are at least three contestants in the race. AROUND THE WORLD Cuba to handle high seas hijacker crisis HAVANA (AP) -Armed hijackers seized a ferry off Cuba's coast Wednesday and threatened to toss passengers overboard iffthey cannot go to the United States, setting off a Keeley Stewart along with other members of Iota Phi Theta, Fraternity perform a dance, called Stepping, on Turlington Plaza. The dancers drew a crowd of about 100 people. negotiating drama on the high seas. The FBI said the ferry was drifting in international waters about 60 miles off Key West and had sent hostage negotiators by helicopter to the scene, where they met up with a U.S. Coast Guard cutter. Fidel Castro's government said it would handle the crisis in the Florida Straits. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that Cuba would take the lead role but said it was ready to assist. "What we won't do in any case is to use measures of force that put in danger the lives of the people aboard this boat," Cuba said. It said 50 passengers were on board. An FBI spokeswoman in Miami said later Wednesday that FBI agents at the scene were standing by on the U.S. Coast Guard cutter while Cuban authorities dealt with the situation. volume 96 ISSN 0889-2423 number 133 the independent florida alligator Not officially associated with the University of Florida Published by Campus Communications Inc., of Gainesville, Fla.

UF sues over poor O'Connell Center appearance By Julia (rouse Alligator Writer jcrouse@alligator.org The first thing visitors should see when visiting the campus is not the dirty, gray and mildewy roof of a significant campus landmark, UF officials said. The unsightly and discolored roof of the O'Connell Center is a breach of contract with the construction manager and architectural firm that overhauled the dome in 1998, according to a statement from the UF Board of Trustees. After failed attempts to reach a compromise, the trustees filed a lawsuit Monday for breach of contract against construction company Beers Skanska Inc. and Barger + Dean Architects Inc. The university is suing both parties for damages in excess of $15,000, according to the case file. UF Vice President of Finance and Administration Ed Poppell said the university is not seeking punitive damages, only a solution to the problem. "We are seeking a remedy for what we think is a membrane that does not meet our standards," he said. The structure of the roof is not in question, just the white, single-ply membrane covering it, Poppell said. Executive Vice President of Beers Skanska Inc. in Tampa, Frank Fralick said Tuesday that the company had been trying to work with the university to solve the problem for about a year and had come to a logjam. "We're not mad at anybody, just trying to work this thing out," he said about the suit. Officials from Barger + Dean Architects Inc. could not be reached for comment. UF is suing Beers, which acted as the construction manager for the remodeling project, because it has failed to take responsibility for and repair the roof, according to the court document. Barger + Dean, architects for the project, recommended the faulty material, failed to properly design the roof to ensure against aesthetic and/or structural defects and did not advise and consult with UF officials regarding the construction, design and materials, according to the document. The building was built in 1979 with an air-supported, tent-like fabric roof, Poppell said. The translucent quality of the roof limited what the university could do with the building and what events it could bring to campus. UF also could not play host to a circus or certain concerts because the lightweight construction of the dome could not hold the weight of a trapeze or speakers and stage sets, he said. The university decided to redo the roof in 1998 with a hard roof that could be walked on and support heavy equipment. According to the court document, the roof began to discolor less than a year after it was completed.

4. AL~rlGQR, AI4l9 PSU accept KISS apology By April Simpson Alligator Writer asimpson@alligator.org A dispute between an area radio station and a UF student organization has been resolved. KISS 105.3 President Doug Gillen e-mailed Pride Student Union President Michael Roedel to apologize for refusing to broadcast from a PSU event and offered to broadcast from any future PSU events. "First off, we are very pleased with KISS 105.3's reconsideration of the decision that was originally made," Roedel said. "We feel that this is a great victory in terms of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning community." Gillen initially wanted to respect the personal nature of some issues with regards to listeners who listen to KISS 105.3 with their children. "It seems that the listeners who have supported our decision do not feel real strongly because of the fact that we already air-recorded commercials about these issues," Gillen stated in the e-mail. "Furthermore, and unfortunately, my goal of respecting privacy for some has really, really hurt the feelings of others. For that, I truly apologize." PSU provides a resource and a supportive atmosphere to GLBTQ students and to their friends and relatives. Roedel said his organization is striving to educate on and end homophobia. If an organization, or in this example KISS 105.3, is willing to learn from this experience, then the organization has achieved its goal, Roedel said. Roedel thanks SG, especially Student Body President Nikki Fried and Student Body President-elect Kyle Jones, for their support and backing that has made the KISS 105.3 decision possible. Fried said if Roedel accepts the apology, SG is willing to allow student organizations to reinstate advertising with the station. "I have always operated our company based on the principle of trying to be sensitive to our listeners' needs, and obviously they don't need us to hurt their feelings," Gillen stated. "We cannot please all people all the time, but we certainly shouldn't hurt any people, ever." SG coins memorial award By April Simpso Alligator Writer asimpson@alligator.org Student Government senators approved a bill to establish a yearly award in honor of a deceased faculty member who strove constantly to unite the student body. Jim Scott, former vice president for Student Affairs, died of cancer on Sunday, Feb. 16. Senators established a yearly James E. Scott Bridging the Gap Memorial Award in his honor at Tuesday night's senate meeting. The award will recognize both a student and administrator who have demonstrated a commitment to uniting different segments of the campus community. UF Student Body President Nikki Fried told senators that recipients would have gone above and beyond expectations by breaking diversity barriers and uniting the student body. It's important that we recognize individuals who are continuing his mission, Fried said. The student body president and vice president for Student Affairs will "Ti1IOFF!

ICanddae infuse election section witecc Alligator Writer kmjones@alligator.org When it comes to choosing a 'city commissioner for the At Large I seat, voters have five distinct individuals to pick from: a college professor, a homeless advocate, an environmentalist, a businesswoman and an X-ray technologist. Each has different objectives, personal experience and opinions, but they share -one common interest -serving the city of Gainesville. Francis "Pat" Fitzpatrick pushes a shopping cart to the downtown clock tower almost every afternoon to counsel and feed the homeless. The secular Franciscan and counselor decided to run for commission to bring the issues of the homeless to light. I would start at the bottom of the rung and work up, starting with the people who need the help most," he said. He wants to set up safe spaces for the homeless. He's also working on a halfway house. Instead of accepting donations for his campaign, he asked for contributions of socks and blankets. If Shands X-ray technologist Ernesto Martinez is elected, he wants to restore public confidence in local government, provide clean drinking water and aggressively protect our wetlands and creeks. After moving here in 1981, he and his wife Debbie opened a business downtown, which he closed after the city commission voted to two-lane Main Street. "Citizens tell me they want a commissioner who is willing to listen to the-people,, evaluate information, articulate concise statements and make qualified decisions," he said. "I have that ability and courage." Three years ago, Martinez ran for city commission but lost to incumbent Warren Nielsen. Nielsen, who moved here 35 years ago, envisions Gainesville evolving into a thriving, great university city like New Haven, Conn., or Boulder, Colo. With UF being one of the largest universities in the country, he said he doesn't feel Gainesville is up to snuff socially, eclectically and economically. "We don't have a really healthy street life. Gainesville doesn't greet each other very well," Nielsen said. To promote people-watching and an eclectic community, he wants to implement a multifaceted transportation system, creating more green space and making a pedestrian-friendly downtown. Nielsen feels he represents the entire city because he already has experience with city government. "I've had the ability to connect with all kinds of groups in the city, whether it's business or environmental, East-siders versus West-siders or the university community," he said. One voice that Nielsen hears often at city commission meetings is that of his opponent Harold Saive. Since 1999, Salve has answered the call of concerned residents from areas like Walnut Creek and Turkey Creek, who feel their neighborhoods are threatened by commission actions. "The city commission never feels the pain of the neighborhood that's trying to protect itself," Saive said. "They always feel the pain of the developer with the deep pockets." Saive said he believes in wise growth and protecting the wetlands, an issue very important to im. By working with many citizens and groups in Gainesville, he said he would stop the feeling of disconnection citizens have with their goveinj6hef Betsy Whitaker also knows about rowth. As the first female president of the local Chamber of Commerce, she's made her living in developing Gainesville. "I started 35 years ago with two nickels to rub together," she said. "I have worked my way from the bottom up in this community, and I haven't forgotten the little guy." The only woman running for the currently all-male city commission, Whitaker said she wants to run the commission more like a business. She started working when she was 14 years old because she wanted to financially support herself. Since -then, she's opened two companies and rehabilitated a shopping plaza and the Seagle building. If elected, she wants to change Gainesville's anti-business attitude and turn Southwest Second Avenue into a bustling thoroughfare to downtown complete with a trolley to shuttle people to and from campus. "The beauty of Gainesville is in its diversity," she said. "I don't want to see it turned into a concrete jungle... but there has to be balance."

.6, ALL1CGTOR, jTUSI4yt  A Q3 Dependent since 1973 Heather Leslie Editor Cameron Ackroyd Editorial Page Editor Sarah Anderson, Andy Davis, Devon Nunneley, Ryan Kent i. Editorial Board Affirmative action Supreme Court should uphold University of Michigan policy The U.S. Supreme Court began hearing two cases alleging discrimination in the University of Michigan affirmative action program Tuesday. The system works like this: applicants are ranked by a point system that rewards students with high GPAs, high SAT scores, extracurricular activities and other factors. Minority applicants receive extra points based on their race. The white plaintiffs argue this is a violation of their'constitutional right forbidding racial discrimination. First off, let's consider why the 14th Amendment -the one relevant in these cases -was originally ratified. The amendment came shortly after the Civil War to officially end slavery in the United States. It came after Jim Crow laws blatantly refused to desegregate the South. Yet today the plaintiffs are attempting to exploit it to the detriment of the very people the authors sought to protect. History aside, the plaintiffs' case lacks merit -plain and simple. Supreme Court precedent supports the use of race to promote diversity on college campuses. The courts and the federal government have endorsed the use of race as a factor amongst many in considering applicants for admission. The University of Michigan, like many other colleges across the country, has realized the incredible value of diversity in an academic environment. Diversity is so valuable in fact, that many Fortune 500 corporations, among them Intel, Microsoft and GM, have publicly stated their support for affirmative action programs. Even the military has spoken out in support of the University of Michigan because of the important role that diverse leadership plays in the armed forces. Opponents argue that affirmative action programs create hostility within university communities. When minority students are admitted to an educational institution, despite having lower GPAs and standardized tests scores than average white students, the assumption is made that those minority students must be inferior. People assume that the admission of all minority students was solely dependent on a quota system. Minority achievements are seen as less deserved. However, opponents are missing the point: standards aren't being lowered. Instead they're being changed to eliminate white, wealthy favoritism. The University of Michigan is simply valuing diversity along with numerous other categories when they select their student body. The University of Michigan admissions board considers all entrants to be highly qualified to attend their top-tier school. S The student body reflects the type of people Michigan wants to S lead their state and nation. ( And the stigmatization argument is overplayed. Students who are deserving of their admission will prove so once given the opportunity. Besides, students invited to attend a university based on a family legacy face similar stigmatization, but it doesn't hinder their development. Just ask President Bush.

Ciii-370--m6" Apathy is wrong attitude to take toward Iraqi war Editor: I am writing to a send big, sarcastic thank you to Nick Weidenmiller for encouraging the rampant apathy of our generation. Just in case you might have been feeling a little bad that thousands of people are dying because of the inept foreign policy of the Bush administration, good old Nick is here to tell you that not giving a damn is a-okay. Just absorb yourself in your fake breasts, your brand new SUV and your grande latte from Starbucks because, in the end, it is highly uncool to care about anything whatsoever. Hooray for self-absorbed materialism! That is really what this country and the rest of the world need right now. So everyone disperse, go buy some beer, try to get laid and don't bother those important people in the White House, because they really care about you and protecting your interests -you can trust them. [Think Vietnam, civil rights movement, women's suffrage, Iran-Contra Affair, 'trickle-down' economics, tax cuts for the richest 1 percent (yes, I'm being repetitive), Halliburton, Richard Perle, Total Inormation Awareness, numerous assaults on civil liberties and, oh yeah, war.] The reason apathy is not cool is that when people care about what's going on in the government, the leaders have to be careful about what they do. When no one cares, the leaders merely have to not go too far and piss people off. Notice that it took Bush over a year from mentioning Iraq on the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, to going to war, but it was all done in small steps. Half-truths and blatant fabrications about Iraq's connection with 9/11 and possession of WMD were repeated often enough that a significant portion of the population now accepts them as true. So, regardless of whether you agree with my politics or not, pay attention to what is being done in your name at Wil Democracy take hoid in Iraq after-the war? NOl &%. home and the world over. Eventually, our irresponsible foreign policy will come back to bite us, as we have unfortunately found out the hard way. Adam Robinson 7EG Affirmative action wrong, Court must repeal policy Editor: Affirmative action is inherently unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court, any law that makes a classification based on race will almost always be struck down. The few instances where a race-based classification will be upheld is when the government can show a compelling purpose and the means chosen are necessary to the achievement of that purpose. When affirmative action programs were instituted, there was most certainly a compelling purpose, which was to overcome the overt discrimination of minorities in the workplace. With regard to schools, students were bused outside their district to achieve racial integration. At the time when these types of measures were implemented, they were necessary because of the racist attitudes and strong racial tensions in America. I believe it is safe to say those attitudes and tensions almost have disappeared. Of course that assumption does not speak for everybody, but at least a good majority. I do not believe the government can articulate a compelling purpose for upholding affirmative action. The current Supreme Court case dealing with the Michigan'students who were denied admission in favor of less academically qualified minorities is exactly what the Constitution aims to prevent. There is blatant favoritism based on race. David Yarema 2LW Should the Supreme-Court rut*against the University o Mhi' a*frNve dion policy. TO cast y wotlg twwtowJ -in.

8, ALLIGATOR, THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 2003 UF student, man charged with damaging tw truck Staff Rport After allegedly firing multiple shots into a tow truck and streetlamp, a UF student and his friend were jailed on two felony charges. Dusten T. Bruens, 27, and Matthew A. Marriott, 28, were arrested and charged with discharge of a firearm from a vehicle and felony criminal mischief early Wednesday morning after causing more than $1,000 worth of damage to an Ultimate Towing truck. Police responded to 907 SW Third St. at about 3 a.m. after there were reports of shots being-fired, said Gainesville Police Department spokesman Keith Kameg. While there, officers found eight spent shell casings on the ground, he said. Jeffery Evans, inside Ultimate Towing's office, heard the gunshots and saw a dark-colored Nissan 300ZX fleeing from the scene, according to a police report. The right front and rear tires were flat and both rims were damaged by bullet holes, according to the report. Ray Warrick, general manager of Ultimate Towing, said the Nissan was held in its lot -which they share with Elite Towing, the company that towed the car in February.

10, ALUGAro, THURSDAY, APRIL:3, 2003 State lawmakers investigate amendment alternnatives ByJon Custer Alligator Staff Writer jcuster@alligator.org TALLAHASSEE -In response to a slew of controversial, voter-approved amendments to Florida's constitution, lawmakers are looking at revising the way changes to the state's fundamental governing document are made. But two measures to make amendments more difficult sparked a debate in the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee on Wednesday, though both passed with reservations. Most senators conceded that the standard of voter approval should be raised, but they disagreed over exactly how and by how much. One proposal by committee chairwoman Sen. Anna Cowin, R-Deland, would require a majority of those voting to approve the amendment, a subtle change that would effectively turn a blank spot on the ballot into a "no" vote. This is the least onerous of all these proposals before us," Cowin said. Her plan passed 7-4, but several supporters said it would need significant changes for them to pass it again. "I can't vote for it on the floor like this," said Sen. Nancy Argenziano, R-Crystal River. Sen. Bill Posey, R-Rockledge, who called the current simple majority "mob rule," sponsored the second proposal raising the threshold to two-thirds. It passed with one objection. "I make no apology or denial that this is designed to make it harder to amend the constitution," Posey said. "It's ludicrous, and I think most people recognize that it's ludicrous." Despite their offerings of support, some senators argued that raising the standard CIRNWO $16.98 Twilight after 1pm (352) 334-3120 S-I tax/Weekdays.

"This is about so much more than one constitutional amendment," said Rep. Paula Dockery, R-Lakeland, whose husband, "Doc," spent $2 million of his own money to support a high-speed rail amendment in 2000 that both parties have suggested repealing. "This is about people out there who get frustrated -there has to be an outlet for the people," she said, but added, "I'm in favor of some reform." Senators appeared lukewarm about a related plan to allow citizens to change laws through ballot initiative, spearheaded by Sen. Rod Smith, D-Gainesville, whose bill on constitutional amendments wasn't addressed. "I'm on the losing end of this issue," admitted Smith, who said he Would work with other legislators to make the measure more paatable. But he sai4 letting citizens propose laws directly was necessary if lawmakers were going to make it harder to change the constitution. "I believe we need to have direct democracy," he said. "But the subject matter in the constitution needs to be different." Under current law, any citizen who gathers 500,000 signatures and has his or her language approved by the courts can get a constitutional amendment on the ballot, where a simple majority of voters can approve it. During the last election, voters approved amendments to reduce class sizes, an public smoking, reorganize higher education and protect pregnant pigs, despite complaints from lawmakers who now must figure out how to implement and pay for the measures. i R7 -rlqm

Sponsored by the Campus Diplomats, the session -which also featured representatives from the University Police Department, Student Legal Services, Office of the Ombudsman and Student Conduct Committee -focused on informing students of their rights as Gators. "We definitely know that students do not know their rights, don't know where to go," said Emma Kiziah, program chairwoman. She said she wanted the panel to include heads of the various departments because even though they are in charge of their respective operations, they still deal with students on a daily basis. Kiziah especially wanted UF Ombudsman Tommie Howard to attend because "the ombudsman can be such a wonderful resource" that many students might not know about. During the discussion, Howard whose office assists students with problems that arise while interacting with the university -said there is no reason students should be afraid to seek help. "My office is pretty much a haven," he said, adding that he sits down to about 600 cases each year. "I don't think there's really a fear, so to speak."

19 AIIG(ATORTTRSDAV APILT. .2003'Health Center evacuated during fire; no one-hurt By StUd Zavaltaro Alligator Writer szavattaro@atligator.org Despite a basement fire, surgery on a monkey continued in the J. Hillis Miller Health Center on Wednesday morning. Heavy smoke flooded the basement level of the Communicore building after welding sparks flew into a nearby container of air conditioner filters, said Arline Phillips-Han, Health Science Center spokeswoman. "The basement floor is entirely occupied by research animals," she said. "It's the home for small animal research facilities of the Health Science Center." Although people were evacuated from the building, none of the 5,500 mice, 1,993 rats, 34 guinea pigs or 20 rabbits needed to be. removed from the building, Phillips-Han said. "All of them were found to be in fine condition," she said, adding that each animal will be monitored by veterinarians to make sure nothing occurs later. As of [Wednesday] all the animals looked just fine, Phillips-Han said. While no animals were harmed, two people complained of respiratory problems but paramedics determined they did not need further treatment. "The fire itself was put out quickly by the fire department," Phillips-Han said. "Then they also had to deal with some heavy smoke." According to a Gainesville Fire Rescue press release, firefighters responded to the call at 11:43 a.m. to find heavy smoke in the basement. "Our firefighters immediately began to ventilate the area so there wouldn't be any smoke near [the animals]," said GFR spokesman Stuart Schwartz. Phillips-Han said the ventilation included removing the smoke and pumping fresh air in. They were able to extract the smoke and pump in the fresh air quite quickly," she said. The circulation of the air in that building is fresh air, according to the [UF] Physical Plant. That's an advantage." Traffic was diverted around the Health Science Center and Shands at UF for about one and a half hours, said University Police Department spokesman Joe Sharkey. "Traffic wasset up at Museum Road and Center Drive at the engineering building," he said. 'We had officers on scene.

THURSDAY,A P* Workhop helps military families form su UF COUNSELORS, STUDENT TO TRY TO-HELP ALLEVIATE THE PAIN OF WORRYING ABOUT FRIENDS AND FAMILY FIGHTING IN IRAQ. By Mary K Willis Alligator Contributing Writer Her eyes filled with despair as she revealed that she did not know when her father was ,coming home. Allyson Hartley, a UF public relations sophomore, has not seen her father since his January deployment to U.S. Central Command in Qatar. "I've said, 'I'll go crazy,' 'I can't do this,' 'How am I supposed, to do normal college things?'" Hartley said. However, she has triumphed over her grief and turned her personal angst into a source of public support. With the help of several counselors at the UF Counseling Center, Hartley has organized the Deployment Support Workshop. The workshop is a weekly support group for UF students with friends and family involved in the war. The workshop targets students looking to build a support base, said Dr. Paul Schauble, a psychologist at the UFCC who has worked closely with Hartley in organizing the effort. The group will promote support within the UF community for troops fighting in the war, Schauble said. "We're in a position here at the center where we need to be sensitive to the different concerns students on this campus might have," Schaubte said. During this time, students are experiencing an internal conflict between good and evil that parallels the external conflict of the war, Schauble said. Students need to direct their pain in a positive direction so that they can promote good rather-than succumbing to the negativity of war, he said. "That's exactly what I'm trying to do,".Hartley said. Hartley hailed the first workshop, held Tuesday night in Peabody Hall Room 301, a success despite a crowd of only five students and counselors. "It makes me so happy just to hear from someone who has the same concerns," she said. With a father who is a colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Hartley is part of a minority at. UF. She said she wants to unite with others to combat the feelings of isolation that can accompany military families. The group allows students to share their stories of personal struggle while counselors help them direct their emotions in a positive direction. Communication with friends and family is an important outlet for these emotions as it promotes emotional health and spreads the community support effort, Hartley said. Friend and fellow UF public relations major Danielle Raziano accompanied Hartley to the workshop and said she has supported her throughout her father's deployment. Hartley said her own excitement about organizing support efforts has caused Raziano to become involved as well. "I can see that my friends really get pulled into my emotions," Hartley said. "My dad would be so honored to know this is going on right now." The Deployment Support Workshop is scheduled to meet Tuesdays from 5 to 6:30 p.m. at the Counseling Center.

14, ALLIGATOR, THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 2003 Tax program helps students M UF LEVIN COLLEGE OF LAW OFFERS FREE ASSISTANCE TO GAINESVILLE RESIDENTS. By Amy Pedman Alligator Writer aperlman@alligator.org UF students and low-income Gainesville residents who are seeking income tax help have 11 days to take advantage of a program sponsored by the Internal Revenue Service and the American Bar Association. The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program provides free tax help at the UF Levin College of Law each Tuesday through Thursday until April 15. "It's a good way to help out the community," said Brian Arthur, who is a law student and the program's coordinator. Between 20 and 25 assistants work in the program, which helps about 250 people each year. The process is relatively easy and simple, Arthur said. Clients work with volunteers on tax returns and also receive tax advice. VITA usually accepts clients with salaries of up to $40,000 a year. "I consider students the type of people who will want to utilize this service," he said. Laurie Douglass said she has gone to VITA for years. "I can do my own taxes, but I like to verify to make sure I'm doing it right," she said. Douglass said the first time she went to the program for help was because she sold her farm but did not know how to solve her problems. The person who helped her knew exactly what to do, she said. She liked the program so much that she told her friends about it, and now her daughter is using it. SFCC student Ric Hutchinson usually uses TurboTax, a tax software program, but decided to use VITA after he had problems. "I heard about it after seeing a flier, so I decided to go to it," he said. Douglass agreed that everyone with tax questions should 'Use the free service. "UF has some good programs, and we should use them," she said. Are you a male or female between the ages of 18 and 64?

= JI I .[ Candi Andi hits Miami for WMC *s you may already know, the Winter Music Conference was held in Miami the weekend of March 22.Since we ran out of space.last week, we're playing catch-up now. Enjoy! So I went to Ultra last year. I was a virgin raver and had NO idea what I was getting myself into. This year I returned with a little more insight and expected everything, from the fluorescent colors to the whistles. When I first arrived in Miami Beach on Thursday night, it was alive and crowded with people from all over the world. Winter Music Conference draws loads of electronic music fans together each year. With so many dj's spinning each night at so many different clubs, South Beach turns into a quasi-clubber heaven for a week eachMarch. Fliers littered the sidewalks and almost everyone I passed had an enchanting sweaty glow about them. It was like an entire city of people who never stopped partying. They just moved from club to club, from Timo Maas to Fatboy Slim, to Uberzone. My attempts to go to any shows Friday were stopped short when I got into a four-car accident on my way out to South Beach. Well, my car has war wounds, and my passenger friend had a slight headache, but I returned to Ultra 5 for a good nine hours of electronic music, crowd maneuvering, people gawking and, naturally, glowstick ducking. My prepartion: I remembered the strict bag checking from last year, so I methodically only ripped half the top off my cigarettes, so I could hide a few sticks of gum inside. As soon as I got insice,wasn't wandering aimless, staring open-mouthed at drag.queens and candy ravers literally covered in candy. I was on a mission to find out who was playing-at what time and where so I could plan out my day. Let me teli ym*,.his shit got crazy, real crazy. A !W .-..-,W : .. Oakenfold gazes out over Miami. Trying to explain that you are a writer to someone that only speaks roid-rage doesn't really work out so well. He finally let me in only after the police officer cleared me. So I tried. I cornered two guys with artist bracelets and soon found out they didn't even know where Ibiza was. Next I flirted with a guy carrying a record bag, and found out this dreadhead didn't know if he was going to end up spinning at all because "Shit is so hectic." I gave up and went to Sasha and Digweed for some mellow tunes. I got crazy claustrophobic after about four songs and dipped to the drum n' bass stage. Most of my friends left me to see Paul Oakenfold, but I decided to see the insanely talented duoEd Rush and Optical with MC Rymetyme. Forforty-five straight minutes I jumped and twirled around to the aggressive beats while trying to understand the freaky flow pouri out of Rymetyme's mouth. Te energy throughout their entie set kept glowsticks-a-glowing f yr mn orstome. After Ed-JDs. tLand, Viaal, tq i" ade -of TiTiesto. I was entranced. I stood althe top of the hill, behind atlest efght thousand people. Whenever t16. musicprogressed to a point Tiesto took any shred of energy I had left. On my way back to the drum n' bass tent, I chilled for a hot minute to check out Rabbit in the Moon before heading back for the last half hour of AK1200, Dara'-:and Dieselboy (Planet of the Drums). I couldn't sit still for long, so I threw some 'bows in traffic, not really, and surrendered myself to Underworld. This was their first performance in the southeastern U-.S. In-fucking-credible folks; I'm sorry you missed them. -At this point in my electronica adventure, I nearly collapsed from exhaustion. Lucky for me I made it back to my favorite stage in time to see the end of Andy C and Bad Company. Roni Size came on next with Dynamite MC and MC Tali. No, Roni Size doesn't know the extent of my love for him just yet. He was kinda busy spinning records so I thought I would just tell him some other time. Right. Di Craze closed the night out at the drum n' bass stage. As soon as he remixed "In the Club" by 50 Cent to a drum n' bass beat the crowd exploded. People kept jumping on stage behind him to see his quick mixes and behind the back scratches. Even the security guards were trying to get cool pictures with him. Alright peeps, Ultra was off the s h izza ne. If you a re re mote ly fa m i liar with any electronic music and/or mind altering substances, you should definitely try and attend next year. Sure there were probably lik 30,000 people and 50 bath.rooms, but feeling the deep vibrations bouncing off your arm hail is indescribable.

Co eoe, c meiq join the PLUR nation, and rememj ber next time-.you 'go to a ravi don't forget your nose vicks,aj Acco ding to a wide variety of media sources (okay, MTV), it's all about the bling-bling.If your Rolex isn't diamond-encrusted and your Escalade isn't up on 22's (the kind that keep spinning after the car stops), you just don't have it. In fact, many rappers feel so obligated to drape themselves in hideous G u cci/Fe n di / B u r berry threads and fill the sub-zero with Kristal that they spend their contract money right away and end up broke. And hot sluts don't just end up in the hot tub, you have to leave out champagne and cocktail shrimp to lure them there, which can get pretty expensive. So where's the REAL bling-bling? Well, how about all of the talentless record execs raking in millions of dollars to spend half their money on plastic surgery for their litUe trophy wives with names like-"Bunny" and "Muffin." And then there are the album producers themselves, who make ten times as much as the rappers to sit around recording studios puffing on green trees and constructing beats. And then there is Mr. T, the unquestionable King of Bling. There's no topping his wreath of solid gold, and even if you do, he could still twist your head off, and do so with charisma and panache. Besides, now that middle-aged white people use bling-bling in daily conversation, it will quickly fade into the past, just like "talk to the hand" and "wazzup." In ten years we will look back on all of this and realize that rappers all looked stupid, that the emperor was never wearing any clothes, and that it's not the size of the boat, but rather the motion of the ocean. MVP hits home run By Jason Venture Detours Editor Fear not all you Burger King-a-holics. Your royal den of greasy, heart-stopping fast food and piss-poor service located on University Avenue has undergone cosmetic surgery that rivals Michael Jackson's face to becomeMVP Sports Bar and Grill. What once was the Home of the Whopper has undergone a massive reconstruction into a bar, restaurant, pool lounge and dance club all combined into one spacious and conveniently located party spot with parking galore. And if that's not enough, there's an ATM machine two steps from the door for all the lazy drunks who aren't willing to walk to the Bank of America ATM machine at the Florida Bookstore. Not only does MVP have a wide variety of entertainment that appeals to all walks of college life, it's also striving to become an all night hangout that specializes in catering to a Monday night crowd. As of now, MVP is onlyopen until 2 a.m., but their management hopes to expand the hours of. operation past last call, given they will only serve food to the drunken masses-to sober them up before they head home It's a great business corkept; as well as a safe alternative for pa. trons who've, enjoyed one too. jmany 4rinks.'tfanv n.16, id MVP is it. And though MVP doesn't offer the outside appeal that Swamp does, it would definitely be a perfect match for those who aren't willing to sweat their ass off in steaming weather. And all you smokers have no need to worry, you can let the carbon monoxide flow like wine inside until July, after which a patio will likely be added outside to increase the appeal of the semi-queasy green exterior. As for the food, MVP offers a wide range of muchies, Boar's Head Deli sandwiches, burgers and Italian-styled entrees all at reasonable prices. On Mondays, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers and jalapeno poppers with a kick-ass Rasberry pepper sauce will only cost you two bucks. If more drinking and less eating is your mission, a $4 pitcher (or 12) might make your Monday night a bit more exciting. The service at MVP is somewhat slow, but it's nothing unexpected from an establishment still -working out operational kinks.

N OPWBy Jason Venture Detours Editor Beer is all about having a good time, getting trashed to the point of seeing double (even triple) and not experiencing everything you ate and drank earlier in reverse (and possibly out of your nostrils, if you're one of those freaks). Based on that logic, you would like to think that The Annual Gainesville Beer Festival would be better than finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow with a little leprechaun right next to it that you could go kick field goals with. But nothing couldbe further from tfhe truth for this writer, whose trip to the Beer Festival was one miserable endcap to a two-week alcohol binge. The day before the beer festival, I (as I occasionally do) started -drinking at Swamp at about 2 in the afternoon. After drinking endless pitchers and inhaling enough tar to manufacture a spare tire for my car, I somehow madeit to On the Border with the good-natured help of a loyal friend. Did you know that at On the Border they have really tasty margaritas? Yup, they're so tasty you have to drink a minimum of eight in one sitting and get so belligerent that you try to walk out on the bill like an asshole only to be stopped by your roommate's extra nice girlfriend. After that, I made my way home and broke some shit that I probably shouldn't have, but it was worth it nonetheless. After a&, it was only 8 p.m. and there was plenty more ignorant abuse to my liver and lungs that needed to occur to make the nighteven more ultra shitty. Plus, I still hadn't convinced everyone I know that I'm an asshole, and that is very near and dear to my heart. So without further ado, I ended up at some party where I knew no one, yet preceded to drain the keg like I was getting paid a million dollars to do it. Somewhere in the mix, I smoked a ton of cigarettes, possibly a few of them backwards because I was so wrecked and didn't notice that the filter doesn't really have that smooth tobacco flavor I enjoy so much. Next, I think I went to Cluck-U Chicken for two seconds and then went back to the party to finish off that nicely flowin' keg, a feat which I unproudly almost accomplished. Next, I was whisked away to my home where I spent the remainder of my night laying in bed trying not to stop breathing by watching whatever horrible shit was on T.V., like Aaliyah getting gallons of blood sucked outta her in Queen of the Damned. To my surprise, I woke up the next morning ... the day of The Annual Gainesville Beer Festival! Because I already decided that I wasn't drinking and none of my friends would go with me (because I'm an asshole), I found it fairly miserable to go stand around in a hot parking lot with a bunch of sweaty drunkasses, some of whom were from my distant past that I really wasn't interested in seeing. But that's besides the point. The Beer Fest became even more miserable when I couldn't get a cup of water larger than a urine sample to rehydrate my alcohol beaten body. There was plenty of cool food to eat, like wings, pizza and the usual unhealthy sewage All photos by: Matt Marriott Drinking numbs the pain of being a human pin cushion. they call food in Gainesville, but I wasn't really hungry. However, I did see a lot of not-so-cool drunken people and maybe one chick loose her lunch. And the best part is that I didn't pay for it, because I'm with the press, and we expect the hook up, bling-bling style. I'm sure all the other people there had fun, but for something called Beer Fest, it was about as much fun as getting a gun pulled on me by a raging/retarded police officer (which incidentally happened to me, four friends and dog Sunday morning on the way back from St. Augustine beach). Call me crazy. Call me whatever you will, but don't hate me because I think drinking beer outside of the Beer Fest is much better. It does no justice to the true unhinged nature of beer, drinking and reckless debauchery fueled by consuming thi most alcohol humanly possible. Aside from the true-life rumblings of a crazy Detours editor, the Beer Fest was actually a very beautiful experience that united Gainesville's most dedicated drunks, something that could put anyone on the verge of tears like a John Tesh song. Never has there been such a crowd of real people, and the Beer Fest wil! one day bring world peace. Buzzin' like a mofo. Drunk, but not there yet. Ready to drive home.

The new Game Boy might even be a close substitute for your Dad's best dirty magazines. The folks at Nintendo might not have intended for some of the sexual uses I found myself imagining, but then again, these are the same people who tried convincing millions of people to eat their Game Boys by introducing color faceplates named Berry, Kiwi and Grape. It was only a matter of time before they moved on to other sorts of satisfaction.

This, of course, was in an era where DVD players, in-seat monitors and parking brakes with rabbit ear stimulating extensions weren't part of a vehicle's standard options. Best of all, the SP is compatible with all current Advance games, and adds color to all the old-school, ordinary poor man's Game Boy games like "Alleyway," "Tetris" and "Mario Spits on Your Face." Detours tried out "The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past," which also includes a new multiplayer game, "Four Swords." Granted, Link never looked so good with a long sword in his hand.

JOEL KAIMAN SPECIAL UF's progra benefit fro[* new coaches The circus at North Carolina just started, UCLA's should end soon and Georgia is.0il in the middle of theirs. All three are dealing with ihe sc"AW.zing process of hiring new men's basket l coaches. Jeremy Foley must be sitting back n smiling. For the first time in several yea1*it, doesn't appear that UF's athletics direct will have to go through that process o' sport.'7 In fact, it's been a whole few since Foley has had to hire any coach;' During the past couple of y*, it seemed like Gators head coaches were getting replaced as often as Jennifer Lbpez's spouses. Eight head coaches are in their first or second season at UF. With some time having passed since the revolving coaching door stopped, now is a good opportunity to sit back and look at how Foley did in trying to upgrade his staff. We'll leave out football, though. Ron Zook has already been evaluated to the point of ridiculousness. To start off we'l look at the coaches in their second seasons, beginning with baseball coach Pat. McMahon. With this job, Foley took a relatively successful coach, who no one seemed to like, Andy Lopez, and replaced him with a man Saddam Hussein would have trouble disliking. Even better for Foley is that McMahon has proved his coaching ability matches his charisma. McMahon took last year's team to the verge of a Super Regional berth.This year's team wasn't expected to compete for anything and is now ranked 13th in the country and leading the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division. Men's tennis coach Andy Jackson performed a similar feat last season in his first year. Former coach Ian Duvenhage could not establish a consistent program so after a 9-17 season, Foley replaced him with Jackson. The turnaround was immediate as the Gators finished the 2002 season in the NCAA tournament round of 16. This season they've been even better holding the No. 2ranking for the majority of the year. On thewomen's side, Roland Thomqvistwas given the job of trying to replace a tennis coaching, legend. Sfarhes ntainedthe program's status.

I *Psi ion_ stainf1 position FAMU lengthens basebal By Andrew Abramson Aligotor Writer aabramson@alligator.org As the UF baseball team prepares to travel to Vanderbilt for a weekend series, the Gators had one last chance to extend theirseason-high, five-game winning streak before hitting the road. After winning the series against Alabama 2-1 and sweeping Tennessee, UF had its first break from Southeastern Conference play in two weeks against a Florida A&M team it defeated earlier this season, 17-2. Wednesday's result was not much closer, as the Gators won 14-2 in a game that was decided almost as soon as it began. Scoring 12 of the ,14runs in the first four innings, the Gators remained in first-place atop the SEC East and had their last chance to tune up their game before attempting to get their fs road victory of the seasonth~is wked. .Twouldn'tcall this game, a TpMcd essepuet rne I McMahon said. "I thought we defended the field very well and pitched very well. "To play a midweek game was very important for us for a lot of reasons, particularly from a pitching perspective. Guys that might not have pitched this weekend got an opportunity to go out and compete against outside competition. As a result of that, I think it was huge." The game saw milestones set for several players. Sophomore pitcher Pat Rumble picked up his first win of his career, throwing for two innings and giving up one hit while striking out a batter. Senior pitcher Jamie Goldfarb saw his first action of the season after suffering a shoulder injury in the preseason; [Goldfarb's injury] was so unfortunate because we counted on him so heavily going into the season," McMahon said.

In came Ron Zook, and in came a flood of thoughts. "I was kind of worried because I felt like last year I had a good chance of being able to get into the rotation a lot before the coaching change," Lamar said. "But then, when the coaching change came, I had o [prove] myself all over again, which kiind of discouraged me. "But being able to build that relationship with the coaches and being able to go out there and show them what I can do and getting in on special teams kind of built my confidence and took that worry away." Lamar's trying not to let those worries come back this spring. Playing in all 13 games last season, which included leading special teams with 16 tackles and recovering a fumbled kickoff return against Tennessee, appears to show he will have a place on the Gators. That place. could be as a starter. "He's got a real good chance," Bailey said.

Lamar is battling with Deshawn Carter for the fourth and finahspot. Carter has experienced breathing problems the last twoweeks and did not go full speed at Tuesday's practice, which could put Lamar ahead heading into the Orange and Blue Game April 12. Lamar said he knows he has a chance. He still doesn't see the spot as his, though. "As of right now I have a lot of things to improve on, but the position is open, and there's alot of us tom peting for that position soI'm just trying to minimize all my mistakes and do the best," he said. Lamar, who grew up in Fort Lauderdale and went to Dillard High, had offers from Troy State and Eastern Illinois. He said he chose UF because education was important to him, he wanted to remain -close to his family and he thought he might have what it would take to play at the Divson-I I401. initially, however, he wasn't so sure.
