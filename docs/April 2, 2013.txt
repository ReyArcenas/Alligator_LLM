Read the story on page 4. NATHALIE DORTONNEAlligator Contributing WriterFour years ago, Aisha Robinson woke up with a purple nose. She said the doctor told her hed only ever seen a nose that purple inside one of his textbooks. Today, the 21-year-old UF criminology senior treats her allergies with medication to avoid the severe symptoms most UF students can expect because of the warmer weather. Dr. John Harwick, assistant professor in the UF Department of Otolaryngology, said the warmer weather this year caused trees to pollinate sooner: in mid-January. In fact, Gainesville is expected to have moderate pollen counts today and Wednesday, according to the Weather Channels PollenCast. Harwick said pollen tends to stick to the ground on rainy days. But on windy days, pollen spreads easier. He said pollen counts tend to be highest between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. Harwick said tree-allergy season is ending and grass-allergy season is starting. Common allergy symptoms are sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes and nose. Solansh Hernandez, 20, said her allergy symptoms got worse when it was cold about two weeks ago. When its hot outside, its not as bad as when its cold and windy, said the UF psychology and marketing sophomore. Harwick recommends allergy treatments like saline nasal rinses and over-the-counter antihistamines. He said people with allergies should keep their windows closed and limit their outdoor exposure. Hernandez said she tries not to go outside. I dont consider myself an outsider, she said. I just cant go backpacking or on adventures in the forest.Warm weather brings high pollen counts to Gainesville sooner ABOUT 150 SPACES ARE NOW AVAILABLE AT 2:30 P.M. SHEA PEREZAlligator Contributing Writer menting with eased restrictions at a lot near Southwest Recreation Center. Students can now park in the lot on the west side of Bledsoe Drive an hour earlier than before: at 2:30 p.m. The lot has 149 spaces. Its something we have talked about for we can have parking options out here, said Director of Recreational Sports David Bowles. But it was the students on the board of directors at RecSports who mentioned the idea again and persuaded UF Director of Transportation and Parking Services Scott Fox to change the time. I hope this accommodation makes it easier for students to access the Southwest Rec Center, Fox said. The time change took effect last week and will continue until the end of Summer B. Transportation and Parking Services staff will then determine whether to continue it during the Fall, but RecSports would continue to fund it through the activity and service fees Student Government allocates. Student Body president-elect Christina Bonarrigo said it will cost $934 to move the parking restriction time an hour earlier through Summer B and $2,046 to permanently extend the time for the next year. Emily Daniels thinks the time change will be convenient for students. Maybe this will encourage more students to utilize Southwest, said the 21-yearold UF psychology junior. It really is a luxury for us, as students, to have such a nice gym with so much to offer.UF tests allowing earlier parking near Southwest RecAllergy season in full bloom I hope this accommodation makes it easier for students to access the Southwest Rec Center.Scott FoxUF director of Transportation and Parking ServicesHarwick KATHRYN VARNAlligator Staff WriterIn response to his March arrest, Mayor Craig Lowe entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the state afternoon. The agreement drops Lowes DUI charges and requires him to participate in a DUI intervention program, State Attorney Bill Cervone said in a statement. Lowe can participate in the program because he doesnt history. As part of the agreement, Lowe must donate $500 to cy CDS Family & Behavioral Health Services, pay a $100 hours of community service, complete DUI school, complete an alcohol/substance abuse evaluation and subsequent treatment, give up his drivers license for 14 days and plead guilty to reckless driving. Cervone said this type of agreement allows the courts to address the case without protracted litigation that does nothing but subject all involved to needless expenditures of time and resources.

TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 3 LAUREN RICHARDSONAlligator Contributing WriterNext time youre considering being the responsible friend, it might be a better idea to reach for that next beer. A study conducted by Pennsylvania State University researchers found those who attended college eventually developed a more responsible relationship with alcohol compared with those who didnt. Maureen Miller, director of GatorWell Health Promotion Services, said she thinks these results show many college students are so focused and driven, alcohol doesnt play a large role in their priorities or in their lives. College, in general, has a reputation for unsupervised partying, but Miller said she thinks these types of things really depend more on the type of person someone is. Kaley Thomas, a 19-year-old UF psychology freshman, said she was surprised by the results because she knows a lot of students who started drinking after they got to college. with the freedom, she said. UF criminology senior Claudia Cobreiro, 22, said she realizes how true the results could be. I understand how, in this economy, people with less education can succumb to alcoholism as a means of escaping the problems they may face, she said.College drinking leads to responsibilityCAMPUS VERONICA SALGUEIROAlligator Contributing WriterImagine taking a class at UFs Nadine McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion where there is a slight Since Fall, SawStop, a new safety system, has been used in the scenic design workshop for theater and dance classes such as stagecraft. SawStop technology detects the electrical properties of the objects the blade contacts, according to the systems website. Human skin is more conductive than wood, and the SawStop system is able to distinguish the difference in its electrical conductivity. It is programmed to stop the blade within milliseconds if it detects human skin, usually resulting in just a Zak Herring, technical director at UFs School of Theatre + Dance, said hes never had a UF student harm his or herself on the table saw. Even so, Herring said the SawStop is an additional safety tool. However, it isnt without its the blade when in contact with other materials. If you cut a wet board, itll do the same thing, Herring said. Because of the systems inability to distinguish a damp board from a cant be cut when the system is on. Cecilia Padilla took stagecraft before the SawStop was installed. It was a little scary just to know that its all based on your actions, said the 20-year-old theater and English sophomore.

LAUREN ACTONAlligator Contributing WriterTaking the GED test on the computer could be a blessing or a curse. Director of public affairs for the GED testing service CT Turner said he has received positive feedback about the digital version. He said adults are favoring the computer-based test because it is less stressful. Brett Gerson said he would prefer taking a standardized test on the computer for this exact reason. The fact that I could start and stop the test when I wished reduces the stress of it, said the 21-year-old UF business administration junior.

Turner said the only way people can be sure they are taking the real GED test on a computer is to go to a GED test center. He said other than the fraudulent online tests, the digital GED test has been a success and has cut test time by two and a half hours. The statistic I was most excited about was that about 60 percent of adults who tested on the computer were more likely to retake a failed test, Turner said. When the computer-based test is fully launched next year, the price will increase from $70 to about $130, Turner said. Cheryl Etters, the press secretary for the Florida Department of Education, said the digital GED price might affect adults taking the test.

ALYSSA NIEVESAlligator Contributing WriterUFs provost announced Friday that Michael Reid will be serving as the new dean for the College of Health and Human Performance starting in July. It is clear that the people in the College of Health and Human Performance have some really exciting ideas and interesting initiatives, both in research and education, and as dean, its my job to help make those things happen, said Reid, a professor and chairman for the Department of Physiology at the University of Kentucky. Reid underwent two rounds of interviews, and after the fourmonth-long process, he received his offer letter last week. This is all so very new. Im still shocked, he said. He said the college has a lot of room to grow in research and edlearning. Reids research focuses on the mechanisms that contribute to muscle weakness and premature fatigue. He said he hopes to balance his administrative obligations with his research. Im a scientist. I cant imagine not being involved in research, Reid said. College of Health and Human Performance professor Kelli Brown said she assumed her role as interim dean in September. She will leave UF to become provost at Georgia College.

The Florida Highway Patrol reported Lowes blood alcohol levels to be .069 and .061 about four hours after the crash. On Thursday, Lowe entered a formal written plea of not guilty. Cervone said the state attorneys test, both of which he said didnt prove Lowe was too intoxicated to drive, into consideration when making the agreement. As in any court case, civil or criminal, both sides are usually well served by an agreed upon resolution said. As to background issues, the Mayor has been treated exactly as anyone else would be in determingram and any suggestion to the contrary is unfounded. Lowe, who is running for reelection against Ed Braddy in the April 16 mayoral runoff, issued a statement accepting responsibility and apologizing to residents.

LOWE, from page 1CAMPUSNew dean hopes to improve health college IT WAS THE FIRST OF THREE FORUMS. BILLY KENNEDYAlligator Contributing WriterGainesville mayoral candidates Ed Braddy and Mayor Craig Lowe discussed their driving under County Health Department on Monday night. The debate kicked off with a question about whether voters should take Braddy and Lowes DUI arrests into consideration. Lowe was arrested March 21, and Braddy pleaded no contest to a 2006 DUI charge during his term as District 2 city commissioner. Both candidates said voters should choose if their past arrests will affect their votes. All I can offer is how I responded since that situation, Braddy said. Lowe also responded with an apology. The candidates also discussed transportation, economic development and the biomass plant at ing up to the April 16 mayoral runoff election. The African American Accountability Alliance hosted Mondays forum, and about 60 people attended. Lowe said he believes there needs to be a balanced approach to the introduction of bus rapid transit to the city and shortened wait times on Regional Transit System bus routes. Braddy agreed but doesnt support bringing bus rapid transit, adding he wants to improve RTS routes in east Gainesville. On economic development, Braddy said the key is to remove barriers that prevent small business from starting up across the city. Lowe said economic development should come in the form of targeted tax incentives for businesses. Regarding the citys biomass contract, both candidates were split in the citys recent decision to bring the plant to the area. Lowe, who supports bringing the plant, said it will diversify the citys fuel source, adding that the City Commission and Gainesville Regional Utilities are working to reduce a utility rate increase to residents. Braddy said he opposed the plant going online and is concerned about future utility prices. The threat to our affordability is in the contract, he said. That is the issue.

TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 5 ITS UFS FIRST YEAR PARTICIPATING. BRITTANY BOKZAMAlligator Contributing WriterCritically acclaimed childrens author and illustrator Peter Ss will speak at UF today. His presentation participating in International Childrens Book Day. Hes an exceptionally talented, brilliant illustrator and childrens book creator, said John Cech, director of the Center for Childrens Literature and Culture. Traditionally held on Hans Christian Andersens birthday, International Childrens Book Day is a celebration of childrens literature and storytelling, transcending the bounds of geography, language and culture. Ss will speak at 7 p.m. at the P.K. Yonge Performing Arts Center about his work and the powerful force of books as communication tools across cultures. Cech said childrens books are an important means of breaking down global barriers. Although they may follow simple plots, these stories address universal themes. Childrens books can be dark, he said. They can be complex. They can be ambiguous. They can deal with all sorts of issues. Ruth Lowery, an associate professor in the UF College of Education, is concerned with helping her students get a global perspective on literature. The focus for me is that we all acknowledge the presence of books in our lives and that stories are from everywhere, she said. Along with Ss, storyteller, educator and writer Barry Stewart Mann will be speaking at multiple venues, including Santa Fe College and the Alachua County Library. At 2 p.m., he will be at Smathers Library to give a presentation on storytelling.Childrens Book Day at UFLIFESTYLE BEATRICE DUPUYAlligator Contributing WriterWhen anti-smoking TV ads from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention appear while Gabby Gostigian is baby-sitting, she changes the channel. Gostigian, a 19-year-old UF zoology freshman, said the ads can sometimes be a bit too graphic for children. The CDC recently released new ads, funded by the Affordable Care Acts Prevention and Public Health Fund, that focus on the stories of people affected by smoking. The ads are expected to run for at least 12 weeks and will be on the TV, radio and billboards, according to the CDC. The new ads feature Terrie, a former smoker rent smokers to record their voices so their loved ones can know what they sounded like before smoking impacts their voice. Before, the ads showed Terrie preparing herself for the day by putting in her dentures, covering the hole in her throat with a scarf and wearing a wig. Although the ads are a continuation of the CDCs prior anti-smoking campaign, local residents are questioning the ads presentation of smokings impact on people to send a message. Andrew Romero, Alachua County tobacco prevention specialist, said ads like Terries are effective but can sometimes generate controversy. These ads also seem to be incredibly effective in encouraging and moving smokers closer to wanting to quit, he said. Maureen Miller, director of GatorWell Health Promotion Services, said the ads might not work well with the younger population because they believe itll never happen to them. It doesnt really resonate in terms of changing their behaviors, especially when were talking about tobacco, she said. Simon Persico, a 22-year-old UF business junior, started smoking when he was 17 years old. He said most smokers dont see themselves quitting until theyre older, adding that the ads are scary because they reveal the worstcase scenarios of smoking. The ads are obviously a good idea, he said, but I think theyre a little sensational.Gainesville residents react to graphic anti-smoking ads

Its not like either are new concepts: the guy who cant get a girl even though he is such a nice guy and the guy who has feelings for his friend, but she doesnt feel the same way toward him. This can go the other way, of course, with nice girls being the Internet. Just ask the meme Friend Zone Fiona, who will tell you she loves you but isnt in love with you. Im glad both ideas are trending out in the open nowadays because now its fair game for discussion. Although the memes are hilarious, its important to not let anyone wallow in self-pity because thats where something thats sympathetic and funny gets ugly and resentful. Both men and women came forward to argue that just because you are nice to a girl doesnt make her obligated to like you back. Sitting in your current situation and whining about only being a friend isnt doing either of you any good. Either make a move to ask her out, or accept the situation for what it is and move on. Of course, thats always easier said than done, so Im not expecting to see a decline in friend zone complaints for a while. But it got me thinking why most friendzone and niceguy complaints are from men. Well, probably for numerous reasons, including that its considered more normal for the guy to have to summon his courage to ask the girl on a date, not the other way around, and that forum sites like Reddit and 4chan have mostly males users, so both of these things already skew the grievances to come from one direction. I also had another idea. about womens dating preferences enough to create ladder theory and apply game theory, then Im entitled to a theory. I call mine Adam Sandler Syndrome. In early Adam Sandler movies like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy, you can expect that although Sandlers character is not particularly handsome, charming, quick-witted and even borders on mild mental retardation, he will always end up with the attractive female love interest by the end. Why? Because the audience knows that although Sandlers character may not have much mental prowess, he has a good heart, and he ultimately deserves the girl as the storyline underdog. No new information here. Its the same for a lot of cheap-thrill comedies. There isnt really a movie equivalent for women. I actually sat here for a while trying to think of an equivalent situation, and what I thought of was a situation where the character Fat Amy from Pitch Perfect got Channing Tatum by the end of a movie. Havent seen it yet. Or at least if it exists, the critics would consider it wildly avant-garde and groundbreaking. So maybe Average-Joe-always-scores-the-hottie sets up a false expectation for men to believe that, barring all other factors, they deserve to get a woman because they are nice guys with good hearts. And not just any woman, Of course, in Adam Sandler movies, he somehow ends up being the least scummy guy in the plot, so he wins the nice-guy award by default. In reality, there are so many nice guys that its impossible everyone gets what they want. When women and men complain about being friend zoned even though they are such nice people, tell them thats life and to keep moving forward. Or tell them to be born again as Channing Tatum in their next lives, because I bet he never has any of these problems. Lauren Flannery is a business administration sophomore at UF.

The one who got in trouble so much it didnt matter how he acted out next, no one would pay attention to him? The one who, when he acted out the next time, someone got seriously injured? Is that kid North Korea? Because it might be. Like, we hate taking anything North Korea has to say seriously at all. Part of that is, of course, because somehow Dennis Rodman is good friends with Kim Jong Un. No, thank you. Lately, though, it seems like the threat of some kind of attack or war from them is becoming more and more real. Not real in the sense that we should build underground bunkers and hide from bombs by hiding under our desks because those help very little. But real in the sense that we ignored that country for so long because it seemed so outrageous to believe anything it had to say. I consider the current North Korean threats very serious, said South Korean President Park Geun-hye to the Souths generals, according to a New York Times article. If the North attempts any provocation against our people and country, you political consideration. As top commander of the military, I trust your judgment in the face of North Koreas unexpected surprise provocation, she continued.

Carney says the White House takes the threats very seriously. But he says the rhetoric is consistent with past behavior. advanced warplanes, arrived in South Korea and are considered a display of Americas commitment to confronting North Korea. The bombers mission came after threats from North Korea to attack U.S. soil with missiles, a capability the North likely does not yet possess, reported USA Today. While the North is likely blowing hot smoke up everyones collective global buttholes, we dont want them to get to the point where they actually act on a nuclear threat. A Pentagon spokesman told CBS News on Monday morning that the F-22s presence over the peninsula was not a recent adKorean-U.S. war games a preparation for invasion, wrote CBS News.

TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013 ALLIGATOR, 7Growing up, I never thought much about my own family traditions. As a family, we ate dinner at the table, watched movies and went to church every Sunday. I went to church school and went through all the rituals, but nothing I felt was out of the norm. That was until my sophomore year of high school, when I decided I needed to go on birth control. My father is Catholic and, for obvious reasons, wants to pass on his faith to his children. Hes always reading some sort of a book about Christianity aside from his other fantasy novels, and he goes to church every Sunday. My dad, through his upbringing and somewhat paying attention to the pope, believes almost everything that is said as his own. He feels as though its his duty to go to church, bring his children to church and follow all steps to face judgment at the end. None of these traits seem to be bad. Following the church can give someone a sense of being. Its not until he strictly follows the beliefs of the Catholic faith when sometimes you can get taken aback. His views on birth control and women made me rethink submitting myself to the same beliefs. How could I be going along blindly through the Catholic faith without thinking about how they view women as subservient? cause I was little and didnt want to get in trouble. Later, I went to church because I felt guilty and like a bad person if I didnt. Recently, I go to church for my dad. Does this make me subservient? Every now and then I feel like going to the adoration to get total peace of mind. My father must have planted this need to go to church in my head somewhere. Yet, the fact that I have to hide that I take birth control or not discuss certain views with my dad just feels a bit strange. I started to pay more attention to what was being said at church, listening to the readings and then noticing that after one of our priests passed away, the church had a One mass had to be shortened because there was only a pastor there, so the Eucharist could not be blessed. I then looked to all my church schooling and realized women few boys in the school as well. Youd just see them if there was an event where there were heavy things to move or if there was a barbecue. Why? Perhaps its because the ideal of masculinity speaks of being the strongest or the one to support the family. Being a servant to Christ would not sound appealing to these manly-men. Women, on the other hand, are taught from an early age that they are servants to Christ as well as servants to their husbands. But if being a servant to Christ in the present means to follow the church law, its a bit unsettling that these decisions are made up from an entirely male clergy with no option of ever hearing a womans voice unless speaking about the saints or of Mary. Although my father does go to church, he holds his opinions true to the ways in which womens inequality is perfectly sound under the name of God. Caitlyn Manning is an art sophomore at UF.Female subservience perfectly sound in the name of GodGuest columnCaitlyn ManningSpeaking Out As Floridas attorney general, I work to protect Floridians. One of the most alarming and dangerous trends Ive seen since takabuse. Some of you may generally know synthetic drugs as incense, potpourri, K2, spice and bath salts. These cathinones  bath salts  and cannabinoids  spice  are sold under names such as Red Eye, Purple Flake, Scooby Snax, /2 Baked Hulk and Express Barely Legal. Although these drugs are marketed in bright packages and given innocuous names, the fact is they can be deadly. They can cause psychotic episodes, hallucinations, seizures, paranoia, tremors and more. These drug manufacturers are targeting young people. The Drug Abuse its-kind report last year that studied emergency room visits linked to synthetic drug abuse. It found that more than 11,000 emergency room visits nationwide involved a synthetic cannabinoid prodthose visits were from people ranging in age from 12 to 29. One February 2013 CNN article entitled Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana captures just how dangerous and lifealtering these drugs can be. After smoking potpourri, a 16-yearold girl ended up in the intensive care unit for weeks. An MRI revealed that she had suffered several strokes. She nearly died and emerged from the hospital blind and with brain damage, requiring physical, occupational and speech therapy. This girls story underscores just how dangerous these drugs are and why we need to work together to stop synthetic drug abuse. There are three things you, as college students, can do to help. First, if you see these drugs on any store shelf in Florida, call local law enforcement. Second, tell your friends how dangerous these drugs are and discourage them from using them. Finally, if you see someone who appears to be suffering from the effects of synthetic drug abuse or is in any type of medical distress, call 911 for emergency medical assistance. By following these three steps, you can save lives. In closing, I promise you I will remain vigilant in my efforts to rid Florida of synthetic drugs. During the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, I worked with the Florida Legislature to add dangerous synthetic compounds to the Schedule I of controlled substances. This legislative session, I am working with bill sponsors, Sen. Rob Bradley and Rep. Clay Ingram, and the Florida Legislature to add an additional 27 synthetic substances to the Schedule I of controlled substances, making it a third-degree felony for an individual to sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture or deliver these dangerous drugs. We will continue to do whatever it takes to protect Floridians from synthetic drugs, and I ask that you join me in these efforts to make Florida a safer place. Pam Bondi is the attorney general for the state of Florida.Synthetic drugs have reallife consequencesGuest columnPam BondiSpeaking Out Dear Mr. OReilly, I want to start by congratulating Fox News for being the No.1 network in cable news for 11 consecutive years. First Amendment-loving liberals hate when you say that, which is why I like to repeat it. I would also like to commend you (and Martin Dugard) for your best-selling books, Killing Lincoln and Killing Kennedy. I had the opportunity to read both of them, and they were excellent. But, lets cut to the chase. During the Kelly File segment (last week) with Megyn Kelly, you contended the compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals. To you, their argument is compelling because they are Americans, so they have the right to be treated like everybody else does. Further, you argue the other side needs to have a strong argument. But in your mind, they dont. All they know how to do is thump the Bible. rather degrading that you would marginalize a portion of your audience by referring to them, as well as the secular opponents of marriage equality, as Bible thumpers. Yet you question Christian leaders who wont stand up for Easter? No wonder they wont. In your Talking Points Memo on March 25, you shared the story of Ryan Rotela, the Florida Atlantic University student who was asked by his liberal professor to stomp on the word Jesus. In response, you said, There is no question that many college campuses are becoming radicalized. Are you surprised? Its because of individuals like you, who give Christians a bad rap. In Luke 10:27, Jesus tells us to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, strength and mind, and to love our neighbor as ourself. In Matthew 7:1, we are told not to judge, or we, too, will be judged. We are instructed to love everybody, including homosexuals. However, many people also believe marriage is the sacred union between a man and a woman. So, they interpret their religious texts literally  is that OK? Furthermore, you agreed percent with Megyn Kelly when she said she didnt hear anything articulated that was particularly persuasive. Have you considered the arguments that are being put forth by the opponents of marriage equality? Do you realize what it could mean for America if we decide to federally legitimize the union between two men or two women? Do you understand that if it passes, were talking marriage, but also our rights as citizens? How does marriage equality hurt traditional marriage? Ill tell you. If we decide homosexuals have the right to marry, then we will, eventually, have to extend that right to bigamists, polygamists, polyamorists and incestists (if thats what theyre called). Marriage will no lonas the union among two or more people, related or not, who love each other. Pardon me for being dogmatic, but when a society chooses to embrace cultural relativism in the name of equality, that society will cease to distinguish right from wrong. It is my understanding that its not the governments responsibility to legislate morality. Rather, it is the governments responsibility to uphold the values and rights given to us not by man but by God. If you call yourself a Culture Warrior, then act like one. I look forward to your reply. Erik Skipper is an economic sophomore at UF.

8, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013 Vonecia Carswell / AlligatorSevan Terzian, a UF associate professor of social foundations and education in the School of Teaching & Learning, introduces his newly published book, Science Education and Citizenship. STATE MEGHAN PRYCEAlligator Contributing WriterUF students may want to get into the habit of wearing bug spray. A rare human case of Eastern equine encephalitis, a mosquitoborne illness, may make its way to Gainesville after the Florida Department of Health discovered a Tampa resident was infected earlier this month. The virus, also known as EEE, can be transmitted through a mosmation of the brain and eventually death. Jonathan F. Day, UF professor of medical entomology, said although the illness is rare, its commonly found in North Florida. mosquito-borne diseases native to Florida. EEE is considered to be the second-worst disease behind West Nile Virus. The virus usually appears in June and July. However, Day said the disease is appearing earlier than usual, attributing this years mild winter to increased mosquito activity. Its a disease we are concerned about, he said. Day warns of several symptoms related to the disease such as a high fever that exceeds 102 degrees, severe headaches and blurred vision. Some UF students said they arent concerned with the disease spreading. Claire Fassett, 18, a UF food science and human nutrition freshman, said she wouldnt start stocking up on bug repellent soon unless more cases are reported. Teresa Christmas, a 20-yearold UF anthropology sophomore, agreed, saying she doesnt like the feeling of bug spray. [Id] rather get bit than put on that spray, she said.Disease-spreading summer mosquitoes might bring more biteDay KATIE BURNSAlligator Contributing WriterIn a society where science is the future, a UF associate education professor published a book about the history and impact of science programs. Sevan Terzian, an associate professor in the School of Teaching & Learning, recently published a book entitled Science Education and Citizenship. The book explores the initiative to improve science education through his investigation of the history behind it. Many of us are familiar with science clubs and fairs and talent searches, but most of us dont really have a sense as to why they got started and why they remain so popular, Terzian said. The answers came a lot earlier in history than Terzian expected. His book discusses history starting with science fairs in the 1920s through the end of the 1950s. His theory states that by participating in science programs, students develop stronger reasoning skills that are going to allow them to become good citizens. Grace Ooi credits her passion for science to her involvement in extracurricular activities. You read about concepts in books, and you learn about things in class, but it was only because of the exposure I got [from] hands-on learning through science programs where I discovered what I wanted to do, said the 20-yearold material sciences and engineering sophomore. But Terizan emphasizes science education is not just for the future scientist. A democracy couldnt work if you had people who were not able to think rationally or to think like scientists, he said.UF teachers book looks at history of science education

game against either Kansas State or Utah. Certainly, we would have loved to have had the chance to be in the NCAA Tournament and knew we were good enough to be there, Butler said. The things that Im really proud of our team and our staff as well is that (it) had no impact on what we had an opportunity to do. We have been able to use [the WNIT] in a very positive way and now put ourthe opportunity to do something special. The journey is surprising given the trouble the Gators had with winning consistently on the road during the regular season. Florida State handed Florida a 31-point drubbing in Tallahassee on Nov. 15. Butlers squad also dropped a road contest to Michigan during non-conference play. Against Southeastern Conference opponents, the Gators were equally underwhelming on the road. away from the OConnell Center. Floridas only SEC road victories came against Auburn, Mississippi State and Alabama. The Tigers, the Bulldogs and 13th, respectively, in the SEC standings this season. But the Gators have started erasing their road demons with success in the WNIT. The best of them has been revealed this postseason, and I think the road challenges have been a big part of that, Butler said. Its been a great opportunity for us to grow, a great opportunity for them to mature in ways that you just arent afforded the same opportunities when you have the comforts of home. Contact Phil Heilman at pheilman@alligator.org. years at UF, Murphy started once and averaged 9.9 minutes per game. He never really wanted to inject himself into the team like we needed him to, Donovan said. He was worried about chemistry, stepping on toes more his freshman year. But after Murphy completed his sophomore season, his future with the Gators was in question. Murphy and former Gators forward third-degree felony burglary after allegedly trying to break into a car outside of a bar in St. Augustine. ly, but the forward rejoined the team before He bounced back from the incident with He saw an opportunity to step into the role and felt comfortable with it, Donovan said. The last two years, I dont know if theres been many frontcourt players that can stretch the defense the way he can, thats more (of) a team guy than he is. From his freshman year to where he is now, Ive seen incredible growth, both on and off the court. Murphy will have plenty of time to reing which he played in four NCAA Tournaments and made three trips to the Elite Eight. and lows ended on a bitter note, he was unYeah, man, I dont know, Murphy said. Ill think about that after this sets in.

16, ALLIGATOR TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013 JURNY DUTY After a month and a half of sub-par play, the Florida baseball team is coming off its best series of the season, taking two of three games from Ole Miss last weekend. While their 11-15 start before last weekend is a more telling sample, UF should be optimistic moving forward. weekend series of Southeastern Conference play against No. 10 Kentucky and No. 2 Vanderbilt, Florida won the Friday opener. of each series thanks to poor pitching performances on Saturday from Jonathon Crawford and on Sunday from Eric Hanhold. Against the Rebels, those issues were nonexistent. Crawford looked like he did in the latter part of 2012, throwing a complete-game shutout against Ole Miss on Saturday. Freshman lefty Danny Young followed Crawford with 5.1 shutout innings in the best Sunday start by a Gator this season. In last Tuesdays loss to FSU in Jacksonville, Young gave up just one run in four innings and struck Young has earned the Sunday job. Together with Crawford and fellow freshman Jay CarThe lineup is coming around as well. Florida scored four runs off Vanderbilts Friday starter, Kevin Ziomek, who is second in the league with a .157 batting average against. Catcher Taylor Gushue, who was homerless and hitting just .231 before UFs 9-4 win against UNF on March 19, is hitting .400 in his last eight games with three home runs and has brought his average up to .277, The promising weekend also came with two pinch-running appearances from freshman shortstop Richie Martin. Prior to the Ole on March 3. Martin was arguably Floridas the team with 13 hits and ranking third on the squad with a .342 batting average. Florida (13-16, 4-5 Southeastern Conference) hosts UCF (18-11, 4-2 Conference USA)  a team it beat 5-3 on Feb. 19 in Orlando  tonight at 7 at McKethan Stadium. If the Gators beat the Knights again, theyll head into this weekends series at Mississippi State needing only a series win to reach .500. Next Tuesday, UF has another date with FSUs Luke Weaver, which isnt likely to end performance against Ole Miss, Florida has a good chance of once again taking two of three  or at least stealing one game  against No. 13 South Carolina next weekend. So after the series against the Gamecocks, the Gators could realistically be right at .500. 19 games are against top-25 teams. Fourteen of Floridas games to this point and 21 of its ish more than a handful of games over .500 to make the NCAA Tournament. A trip to Omaha might not be a foregone conclusion as it has been in years past for this All-Americans during the offseason, being in the hunt is not such bad thing.
