THE POLL TOOK RANDOM SAMPLES FROM 371 LANDLINE PHONE NUMBERS IN FLORIDA. ANGELICA MARINOAlligator Contributing WriterUF student Andrea Conedera is afraid for her life when her friend drives with her knees so she can text. is like 95 percent of Floridian respondents who support a ban against texting and driving, according to a new poll conducted by the Bob Graham Center for Public Service and the UF Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Emma Humphries, assistant in citizenship at time the center has conducted a public opinion poll regarding legislative issues in Florida. Humphries wrote that in a monthly survey of Floridians, the center asked if people support a bill that would ban texting while driving. She wrote that only 4 percent of respondents opposed the bill. Both the Florida House of Representatives and Senate are reviewing the bill, which would create a ban on texting while driving. The legislation for texting but only if they were pulled over for Humphries wrote, living battleground state, it is not particularly common for an overwhelming majority of Floridians to agree on a public policy issue. texting while driving sends a clear message to legislators: Floridians want this ban, she wrote. The random samples were taken from 371 landline phone numbers in Florida. There was a 4.92 percent margin of error, and the results were weighted by census information to get a general distribution of the state, according to a press release. The survey did not include cellphone numbers. Sixty-two percent of all households in Florida have a landline and 52.5 percent have both a landline and wireless phone, according to the press release. Conedera said people should support the ban because it is helping to keep everyone safe. Texting while driving is a general hazard that can and should be avoided, she said.

We cant be afraid of rocking the boatI went to Lake Wauburg to go kayaking with one of my friends. We rowed around for a good little while, pretending we were pirates, then unsuccessfully attempting to get close enough to a bird to hit it with our paddles. It was pretty enjoyable. But then I got bored. I wondered, What would happen if I rock this boat? I didnt actually end up rocking the boat because I didnt want my buddy to think I was a dumba--, an a--hole or worse: a dumba-a--hole. When we got to shore, he asked me what I would have done if he had tipped the boat over. He said he wanted to, just to see what would happen, but decided not to because he was worried what I would think. So what I want to know is this: Whats wrong with rockinto the water, but who cares? Every unexpected event is a you can tell the next time somebody brings up kayaking. This just brings me to a few of my pet peeves. First is March Madness commercials. Some of them are good. Some are bad. I dont care about those. Im pissed about the ones where the ad company apparently said, Well, this ad worked last year. Lets just use it again. Im talking about that Subway meatball pepperoni melt ad with the gondolier and the Reeses ads (although more so the Subway one). Cmon, guys, what the hell? At what point did it become OK to just recycle the same ads year after year? Those are the only two I could remember, but I know other companies do this. These companies dont even have the pride in their own product to say, Nah, guys, we cant do that. Cmon, we can think of something new. Why didnt they rock the boat? Why do exactly the same thing over and over again when you could try something new and maybe come out of it with a great ad campaign? Related tangentially to my overarching theme is the seeming need by some people (I dont know who, but theyre there) to wipe out everything beautiful in this world. You guys remember the Wild Iris mural? Key word: remember. They painted over the Wild Iris mural. With orange. No, not a cool picture of an orange smoking a doobie or something. Just solid orange. And they painted over the mural by the bridge on 13th. With beige. Beige. Who thought to themselves, You know, I hate art and love solid, boring colors. How can I let the world know? Our generation is locked in a struggle. A struggle with those who want conformity over vibrant difference. People who dont like the boat to be rocked. Toni Morrison, in her Nobel lecture, alluded to this guage smitheryed to sanction ignorance and preserve privilege and says, Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge. There is no way we can defeat the hegemony of the static culture of conformity without rocking the boat, without testing the limits. There are people who will criticize us for stepping outside the bounds they have created and continue to uphold. For them, conforming to a monolithic monoculture is a duty, and they will attempt to ostracize anyone who breaks it. But for us, rocking the boat is a duty. We must continue to push against everything that tries to convince us that different is bad. If we dont, the bad guys win! Dallin Kelson is an English senior at UF. His column runs on Mondays.Hinden-blurg: Why did science just now solve the cause? Did you know the Hindenburg disaster wasnt solved until recently? Yeah, apparently it was a mystery for 76 years until just now. The iconic airship had reportedly become charged with static as a result of the electrical storm and broken wire or a sticking gas valve leaked the hydrogen into the ventilation shafts, reported the Daily Mail. When ground crew members ran to take the landing ropes they effectively earthed the airship, causing ship, igniting the leaking hydrogen. researchers based in San Antonio were the ones to make the discovery. which are the subject of a British Channel 4 documentary to be aired on Thursday, was to rule out theories ranging from a planted bomb to explosive properties in the paint used on the Hindenburg, said a report from The Telegraph. We had no idea this was, like, an unsolved mystery. A newspaper in New Jersey is sort of trying to take credit for the static electricity hypothesis. A May 2012 Star-Ledger story said that static electricity was one of the leading theories to explain the explosion: Three-quarters of a century later, an exact cause for the disaster still isnt known, though theories abound. Everything from the common hypothesis that a static spark ignited volatile hydrogen gas that had leaked, to the theory  put out in a 1975 disaster genre sabotaged the airship to blow up what was becoming a powerful Nazi propaganda symbol, complete with swastikas on its tail airship era and provided a gloomy lead-up to World War II. Like, listen, media. Were pretty sure literally everyone agreed the Hindenburg was brought down by an explosion of hydrogen because that is an obvious fact. Explosions are also created by some sort of ignition. So, dont try to look like some sort of scientist genius just because your paper reported one year ago about the theory of static shock. Also, why is a documentary about the Hindenburg even happening at all? Are we still trying out new blimp technology? No. We suppose were just solving more and more of these unsolved mysteries. We doubt were going to try to create the perfect blimp at this point, as theres hardly enough money to go around the space explorations of our generation. Led Zeppelin album cover art). Possible theories ranged from lightning to a saboteurs bomb, continued the article, planted in an attempt to destabilize Hitlers Nazi regime. The documentary probably explains more about the science behind this discovery, but what a wide range of theories  from Nazi bombs to static shock. To that end, were glad they discovered the real cause. Dallin Kelson opinions@alligator.org

MONDAY, APRIL 1, 2013 ALLIGATOR, 7 A former technological dunce in the age of Internet information, I have recently been coerced by a friend who works as a specialist of search engine optimization into participation in a number of social media forums. My Internet visibility has since expanded from a Now Im on social networks including LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest. I soon noticed a gender disparity in activity on each of these websites. I realized this division was applicable to even my own levels of engagement on each of these forums. I became deeply concerned by the division not only of the sites themselves but also in the quality of information exchanged in female-targeted social forums in relation to those geared toward male participation. LinkedIn is a professional forum designed to connect members with potential employers. It also allows means for business networking. the talents and experiences of the user and build an impression of the user as a valuable commodity. Posting between members is focused on articles expanding upon entrepreneurship, innovation and expert creativity. YouTube is a universally renowned video-blogging site. These videos represent the entire realm of social media exchange from how-to guides, documentaries and political commentaries, to music videos and viral clips of funny cats. The use of YouTube far exceeds this brief overview. Its value as a communicative tool cannot be underestimated for spreading social ideas and contributing to popular culture. men maintain an edge for each of these forums with a percent. Twitter and Pinterest are the two popular forums that are largely dominated by women. and Pinterest is overwhelmingly characterized by a 72 percent female membership, according to the graphic. Twitter is characterized by its use of hashtags and a It is limiting in expression of critical thought. It aims to evoke a quick emotional expression. Pinterest is a site where members engage through an exchange of pictures. The effectiveness of spreading information on this forum is based almost entirely on visual aesthetics, and personal commentary is often limited to very small captions. Reddit is popularly considered the male version of Pinterest. graphic. Though this webpage is far less visually appealing, it is vastly more informative and opinionated in nature. Members post and rank a collection of trending stories, including a substantial amount of technological innovations, political opinions and world news headlines. However, the sites infamy for threads including lewd and offensive depictions of women continues to act as a deterrent to female participation. That such a forum is considered comparable to a fashion, health foods and feel-good stories strongly maintaining contemporary gender roles. On the Internet, men still claim a large exclusivity on forums facilitating the exchange of political ideas and opinions. women. Men dominate those in forums that shape our business world. Women have no comparable sites for public They are instead encouraged to restrict their social domestic life with limited critical insight. The Web is often proclaimed as a social equalizer through freedom of thought. The boundaries of social media exhibit the contrary. They clearly appeal to target gender audiences. They create a deliberate construct through which these groups interact. Social media has become a contemporary instrument through which gender inequality continues to play. Sarah Deatherage is a psychology senior at UF.Social media has continued to modernize our gender roles in societyGuest column Every week, conservative columnists write articles detailing what the Republican Party should do if it wants to preserve its popularity. Several strategists, including the former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff during the George W. Bush administration Karl Rove, have argued the GOP should cave on social issues like marriage equality and abortion and on immigration issues like amnesty in an effort to appeal to more voters. But, unlike the Democratic Party, the Republican Party can pride itself on values and principles. We believe in the power of the free market. We understand there is a connection between political and economic freedom. We say, Ask not what your country can do for you. (We stop there.) The left says, Ask not. (They hate to be challenged.) To us, the scope of government is to be limited and dispersed. We believe the government is necessary to preserve and defend individual freedom. And, despite our entire arsenal, we tend to forget our greatest weapon: Democrats. Last week, I wrote a column about God. In response, the Alligator published a letter to the editor that was (If you havent read it yet, read it now.) After I read it, I wasnt surprised. I thought to myself: Every time I read something written by a liberal, it makes me more conservative. Liberals are good at one thing: attacking Republicans. Theyre effective on offense because they have to be  they suck at defense. Theyre the Florida Gulf Coast University of political parties. Show me a liberal policy they can defend, and Ill show you a carrot the size of a cucumber (see my last column). Liberal Argument Tactic No. 1: argumentum ad hominem (i.e., get personal). This is a liberals favorite style of argument. Why? Well, their views are based on emotions and feelings  not logic. In Rubins opening remarks, for example, he went from dogging the Alligator to calling me out of touch because I watch (and cite) Fox News, the top-rated cable news network for 11 consecutive years. In 20 years (31 years after Fox News is still No. 1), he thinks Ill be a crazy Turlington preacher. For liberals, personal attacks are advantageous in political discourse, which is why I never argue with them. One doesnt reason the foolishness out of the foolish. Theyll convert when they experience the suck of what they preach. Liberal Argument Tactic No. 2: straw man (i.e., racebaiting). If a liberal calls you a racist (or a sexist, or a homophobe, or an Islamophobe or any -phobe), youve won. But remember: Just because you defeated him or her doesnt mean the debate is over. They will continue whining. Like Rubin, they will create a false illusion and shift the conversation to another topic to deliberately avoid responding to your original point  that is, after they call you a racist. Although my argument had absolutely nothing to do with who literally built this country (or, more colloquially, the slaves vs. God), he invoked race in reference to a column that, well, wasnt about race. Liberal Argument Tactic No. 3: argumentum ad ignorantiam (i.e., they say its true, ergo, its true). If theres one thing science hasnt proven, its evolution. And by evolution, Im referring to cross-species evolution. And by referring to cross-species evolution, Im discussing something that matters: faith. Big Rubin (smirk) has every right to believe he debelieve I was fearfully and wonderfully made by God. a hypothesis. It is not a fact. Therefore, it relies on a statement of faith, too. Republicans need not worry about anything. Its the Democrats who should. Erik Skipper is an economic sophomore at UF.

MONDAY, APRIL 1, 2013 WWW.ALLIGATORSPORTS.ORG See story, page 14 Gators in the NBA Sarah Davis / Alligator Senior forward Jennifer George attempts a shot over Arkansas forward Quistelle Williams on Feb. 28 in the OConnell Center. PHIL HEILMAN A look of dejection spread across Jennifer Georges face as she returned to the Gators bench with 8:25 remaining in the game on Saturday. George fouled out after being whistled for a block and watched the remainder of the contest from the sideline. With Florida clinging to a 66-61 lead against James Madison, there was no guarantee the senior forward career. But junior guard Jaterra Bonds ensured George would have an opportunity for redemption. After James Madison reeled off six consecutive points to grab a 67-66 advantage with 6:47 remaining, Bonds came through in the clutch yet again. She sank four free tory in the JMU Convocation Center. Afterward, Bonds said she was thinking about George, the teams only senior, as she stepped to the foul line with a chance to ice the game. Knowing George had not played up to her ability, Bonds wanted to give her teammate an opportunity Gators needed another win. She started off well, but she had a pretty tough game throughout, Bonds said of George. We dont want her season to end because she has worked so hard during her four years here. In the back of my mind, I just was always thinking, I dont want to see her season come to an end here at JMU in this type of environment with all these Gator haters. sistent production during Floridas run through the WNIT. She scored just 5 points on 2-of-10 shooting on Saturday and collected only four rebounds. George is averaging 7 points during the WNIT, a number that would be lower if not for a 14-point performance against Charlotte on Wednesday.

Gators starters held the Rebels to three earned runs in 18.2 innings during the weekend. Junior righthander Jonathon Crawford threw a complete-game, two-hit shutout on Saturday. Young continued the conference start of his career. Sophomore righthander Johnny Magliozzi followed Young and posted back-to-back shutouts since 2010. Its not easy to do in college baseball, coach Kevin OSullivan said of shutting out the Rebels. To be able to do it back-to-back games against a quality team like Ole Miss certainly says a lot about our pitching. Crawford struck out eight on Saturday. He attacked hitters with a mid-90s fastball and a nasty slider. Young struck out one while keeping the ball low. Seven of his 16 outs came on the ground. The Florida defense helped Young with its 13th errorless game. After Young hit Austin Anderson, the second batter of the game, right complete an inning-ending double play. Young settled down after allowthree innings. Dating back to last weekends series against Vanderbilt, Young has given up one earned run in 11.1 innings. Although he picked up the loss, Young kept No. 5 Florida State to one run in four innings in a 2-1 Gators earn first SEC series winEND OF GREGULATION A Boynton and Erik Murphy started their careers, the Gators were coming off back-to-back appearances in the NIT. Remembering the seniors for losing three straight Elite Eight games as a statistical favorite is natural. The Gators, like any other team, are judged on what they do in the NCAA Tournament. Thats how the system works, and none of them would argue with that. Still, ignoring all they accomplished would be wrong. The losses end the season and stick out more than anything, but simply advancing to the Elite Eight three seasons in a row is commendable. So is scoring 2,033 career points, as Boynton did. Or ranking as one of the 20 most Murphy did in 2012-13. Florida went 105-40 during their four seasons on campus. The program stayed at a level where NCAA Tournament appearances are expected rather than celebrated. For a program that doesnt have a ton of class was critical to preventing a backslide. Since Billy Donovan took the job in 1996, Florida has never missed the NCAA Tournament three consecutive times. The contributions of Boynton and, to a lesser extent, Murphy, kept it that way as the Gators snuck A program coming off back-to-back national championships would never fall off the map, and Donovan would never fail to Seniors should be remembered for accomplishments She started off well, but she had a pretty tough game throughout.Jaterra BondsUF Guard UF Baseball SEE BASEBALL, PAGE 15 SEE WHOOPS, PAGE 15 SEE GREG, PAGE 15 Greg Luca
