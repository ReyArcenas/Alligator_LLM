But maybe not fo bugf. Tomorrow, the seven jstices of the Florida Supreme court : are expected to hear oral arguments on a lawsuit that threatens to open the end-of-session, closed-door meetings at which the top lawmakers make-thedirt crucial decisions. Twelve newspaper companies filed suit in early 1982 to open up these meetings after reporters in 1981 were kept out of key negotiating sessions where House and Senate leaders reached agreements on budget caps. Lawyers for the state's lawmakers contend the right to decide if these meetings should be open should not be up to the courts. State lawmakers insist that the separation of powers doctrine gives them the right to devise their internal procedures. They also dispute court intervention by arguing that the courts can oly review legislative measures when ustice ut rule on whether lawmakers follow Costitututional procedure for passing legislation. Court documents filed by the legislative side say: "The case at hand does not present a constitutional challenge to a statute .Indeed there is no allegation that any act passing the 1981 Legislature was not timately debated and voted on by the mem1%fhip of each respective house in open session." The newspaper attorneys say, these behind locked doors get-togethers violate Florida's Government in the Sunshine Law that calls for public business to be conducted in the public eye. Some members of the press corps also say these bargaining sessions are closed because decisionmakers believe they would suffer severe political mockery if the public saw tem backing out on proposals they have endorsed. But, at the same time, it is during these deliberations that issues a're whittled away at, resolves brokendown, compromises mulled over and pacts made on vital pieces of legislation that affect residents throughoutthe Sunshine State., So, as the premise goes for other government business, the blic has the right to know loa decisions and aws that directly concern them asre devised to that input can be given before a proposal becomes enforceable law. And it is this ideal that the Florida Supreme Court should uphold when decision ti-me arrives on the question of legislative secrecy.

"If someofte sees a suspicious-looking person when they come home at night they should drive around and find the nearest telephone," Dunbar said. "We'll be gladto-check them out. if It's someone who lives in the apartment, they probably won't mind because It's the security of the apartment that's concerned."

As she approached thedor, the man had already-opened it and was in the Ipa ttnen, bunba mid. The man pointed a handgun at her and asked her if there was anyone else in the apartment. She told him that her roommate's boyfriend was there, so he grabbed her and grabbed her again and led her down the apartment h*aZ$'t check on the boyfriend. She then kicked him and ran into a bedroom, locking the door, Dunbar said. There have been four such attacks of local women, and Dunbar said the description of the man and the time that he struck, coincides with the other four reported rapes. He said this is the first time the man has used a gun during the crime. The suspect has tried to enter apartments by asking if someone were there, or posing as a prospective tenant for the apartment. Based on information previous victims have provided for police, the man is described as being black, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing between 170 and 180 pounds, and has a shorfafro. Lepgilatur from p.one of English or humanities courses, a college algebra course and to have written 6,000 words. GrwhCOnt*. Crthtls Lawmakers agree that whatever topics the 'big issue list may include, the.majot one is growth management Graham's 1984 Mamendment to his. 19983 85 state budget listed statistics showing Florida's population in 1990 to breach the' 12.5 million mark. The state's school system by 1990 will have taken on an additional 500,000 students since 1970 and the elderly population is expected to reach 2.4'million -a whopping 81 percent increase since 1970. "Everything revolves around our growth issue," Lawson said. "We are growing at an alarming rate of probably a thousand people a week. And people are still coming. That's it. You've got to plan for it." In the 1983 Legislative session, Speaker of the Hose, Rep. H. Lee Moffitt, D-Tampa, created the Growth Management select committee to determine bow ,to ciapprehensively manage groisth. Rep. Sid Marti aiD.awtbornea pembWr of the seleWt: obmftie, di mgroyth managtment,'outlined some of the specific concerns with growth. "If we dAo't control and have certain controllabllitims in growth, growth is going to destroy Florida," he said. "Growth is a big factor. We're golng to grow, regardless of what everybiody in Florida wants. If we don't have quality with the quantity of that growth, we're going to ruin everything Florida'sllabout." Curbing hospital costs In just five years, hospital costs hive: soared 118 percent, according to state statistics, and so there are now three hospital cost regulating bills competing for legislative most severe, Martin says, is sponsored by Graham and Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter and will be reviewed in the senate. The other bills, submitted as a package in the House, are sponsomd by.Rep. Samuel Bell, D-Ormond Beach. I Gunter's bill calls for specific cost regulation effective immediately, while Bell's version outlines a more cooperative approach overshadowed by harsh fines if hospitals refuse to play along. d ttip awson say they expect Bell's bill t gain H approval and Gunter's to do-the sampe in the Senate, andthat a-single eomprotise 4b1i will bestruck betwen the two. "What it is, is that we're going to give the (existing) Hospital Cost Containment Board more money and we're going to give them more personnel from that money to really spotlight these hospitals that are charging way too much over the going rate," MArtin said. "'he way it's got to be done is through persuasion with a heavy stick." The Bell bill would force hospitals to open their financial records for state scrutiny.

SavingFlorids wetlnds On'the environmental frontowolands nd the state's'water quality and'suply has the attention of Rep. Joer Mills, .)ainesville, a'nd'hisNatirl Resoorces con eittee. Mills' committeehas submitted legislation seeking to redefine "wetlands" ir an effort to increase the state Department of Environmental Regulation's (DER) control over Florida's frag envirboment. According to the committee, 60 percent of the state's swamps and marshes which make up wetlandsd" have been destroyed through development. Mills' proposal would change the way wetlands are identified by basing classification upon soil type and vegetation instead of how wet they are. While Martin and Lawson say they will back Mills' legislation, they see problems with it. "Rep. Mills' bill in essence is a pretty good bill except that it is far-reaching," Lawson said. "That's going to be a: hard piece of legislation to ss as it is. Because it affects everybody."-r ners, the'forestry service people are beginning to wonder whether they can own their own properties." Martin said the DER doesn't enforce the rules it has and "already has the authority to do almost everything that's needed to be done in wetlands." "Mills is going to compromise his bill and he's beginning to realize that the DER has the power already," Martin said. "I think they've got the power already and they don't need any more laws. Wetlands is important and if it takes some corrections in the law I'm all for it. But right now, let 'em enforce the present laws and they can save the wetlands."
