The Independent Florida Alligator, Tueaday, April 2, 197, Page 7 Profs say quality counts the most Many UF professors and departments are sensitive to criticisms that they aren't using the best texts available in their classrooms. And they have shown their sensitivity in a variety of ways. In the sociology department, where its chairman, Dr. Gerald Leslie, haseco-authored an introductory sociology textbook with other UF sociology professors, the ethical question was resolved by having the course instructors vote on the best book for the course. The instructors selected Leslie's book. APPARENTLY IT is a good text, for according to a reliable source in the sociology department, it is fast becoming a best-seller. In the physics and astronomy department, a committee of DR. MICHAEL GANNON gave his royalties back to students I SPECIAL REPORT Text By Dennis Conrad I five faculty members selects the texts to be used in all classes The committee's decisions are then reviewed by the department's 44 faculty members. But most selection committees usually exist in departments only as examiners of introductory texts. Other course texts go unexamined, with individual professors deciding what text should be used. THIS BRINGS up the question of standards. Professors sac quality counts the most. But what is quality? Some say any book that satisfies a publisher is good enough to be used in a classroom. But others stress the use of the book in other universities as a criterion. College of Arts and Sciences Dean C. A. VanderWerf suggested five possible ways to determine quality. He said one could get input front the instructor who wrote the book as well as students, departmental faculty and reviews written b experts. VANDERWERF ALSO said the number of colleges using the book is a possible standard, ''but not an absolute criterion. If the practice of using one's oiwn text is unethical ottlv because a professor stands to protit front it, that raises the question of whether a policy should be fornted which could prevent professors frotti vittin ro0altie froon tht'I students. At CF sex eral professors taiacted on their )kn inItrtnft to avoid any appearances of what s 1m1nuht unethical conduct. DR. MICHAEL Gantion. wttiisxlsk a Ron t ath t priest, gave royalties earned tro i a text ie required for h; course back to the students isho had to bu It. Dr. M.H.Teller, of the physics and astrnomtti department' for several years returned his royalties to his publisher so the cost if the book could be kept down. But tue publisher balkekx at this practice. tie said.

IF 'EMONN DR. DAVID CHALMERS royalties paid according to retail price A university. Others are said to hase given their royalties x( scholarship funds or foundations. HOWEVER, IF no policy on royalties is to be developed, complaining students can still register their criticisms with their deans or on faculty evaluation forms. As Dean Robert F. Lanzillotti, of the College of Business Administration, said. "If students are in a captive market situation, and the book is no good, they can use the student evaluation forms to make their complaints known." VanderWerf said he is surprised at the little student input he receives and tie said he would like to hear from anyone having such complaints.

April 2, 1974 EDITORIAL End UF's Locker Room Sexism Yale coed Charlise Brown had been diving since 'he was small, and she had always topped anyone else ss ho competed against her. So ss hen she got to Yale University. she saw no reason at all vhv she shouldn't have the right to join the school's prestigious d is ing team if she ss as cood enough. Charlise cleared the hurdles throws n in her is as and id a tess ntionths ago became a part of Yale's 122. vear-old, aid previiuslV allmale. diving tean. It is as onl one of i series ot s ctorious offenses riade hb is oneni nto n almost completely maledoninmated field -colcgiate athletics. It indicates the mans strides made in recognizing the right of c omen to compete tor things other than men. But it's obsious that here iif Gator Country, cipportunitities for temiale students to compete athletically lag simlinetulls Of the Unliversity Athletic Association's budget of S3,592,334 for the fiscal year 19.3--4, a paltry $24.329 goes to the ssomen's athletic program. This figure points out the several areas in which liF's ssomen athletes get last place at bat for a piece of the monstrous Athletic Association pie: SCHOLARSHIPS: Out of a $632,000 scholarship fund of the Athletic Association -of which $289,000 came from students' activities fees -250 students receive scholarship aid of sone kind. All of the 250 are male. Onis fifteen s.women receive scholarship aid in the torni of tuition swaisers, financed by funds trom the Board of Regents and the profit acCUiulated by UF's sending machines. U until A\pril o 1~3.

The teams for the other women's sports tennis, swintming, gymnastics, basketball, softball and volleyball -must wait for the odd hours when the male teams didn't want to play. For example, the only time women swimmers have been allowed to practice in the pool is between b and 8 p.m. And those on the women's basketball team must use the courts between' 9:15 and 11:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. OTHER BENEFITS: Coeds do not get to stay in comfortable Yon Hall. svhich got almost S 100,000 front the Athletic Association this year. Male athletes receive the benefit of expert tutoring. but there is no tutoring provided for wonen players. Training room facilities and equipment for women pales in quality beside those for the men. Travel expenses for women's teams are so limited that last quarter the svornen's basketball tean had to eo to the Student Senate for $125, after the Athletic Association told them the money couldn't be gotten from the AA's $3,592,000 pot. What may equalize UF's athletic program in terms of sex is something called Title IX, a section of a 192 federal act which prohibits sex bias in federally funded universities such as UF. Guidelines yet to be drawn implementing Title IX are expected to at least require UF to make its men's and women's athletic programs more equal than they are now. if not absolutely equal in terms of funding. Athletic Director Ray Graves said women will get more financial support next year than before, but lie also said there is not the nioney available to PrOVide equal funding for women's athletics. ActUalls that's not tie C Coach. What Coach lrae eans t ccit to stsi is it t'womien's sports were nqal tuntinc, substantial cnihtbks seiid t2 to !C m in I ItIthe iein's athletic programs.

It is the men's teams such as football which are the big money makers, the Athletic Association will shoot back. You won't get people standing in line buying tickets to see women play basketball. Not necessarily, Coach. There's no telling the interest a fine women's basketball team will whip up if it is given the facilities and resources to developas is the mei's basketball team. In Iowa, which has financially well supported women's athletics programs in its state colleges, the women's games often outdraw the men's in the state basketball playoffs. It is to be recognized that the women's athletic program has vastly improved in the past year. A woman trainer has been hired for women athletes and a woman has been hired for the sports publicity staff. And the budgeting for the women's athletic program, comparatively minusdle as it is, represents an increase over the year before. But there is no question that women athletes deserve many more scholarships than the 15 they are now getting. Even though UF's playing facilities are crowded, women's teams should get equal access to UF's pool, gym and playing courts. Women's teams also should not have to beg for travel money from the Student Senate. Yon Hall would not become the first all-male dorm to become coed, and women players have as much right to stay there as do men athletes. For such changes we look to UF's Interim President E.T. York and to Vice President for Administrative Affairs William Elmore, president of the board of directors fo the University Athletic association .Thev can and should bring about the needed changes in UF's athletic program. Such changes should demonstrate to the i Versits contmmtunity and to the state that Ulf is minted to ilkino itself a place of equal opportun it oT hot-h se x.

Daniel Berrigan himself mentioned that Egypt, after 26 nears. agreed to respect, de facto, the existence of the state of Israel. When Asad triumphantly announced this, I hardly slept from excitement. I only wondered why it took him so long. But, what would happen if tomorrow Sadat were to be assassinated and an Egyptian Quadatie were to emerge? To our great sorrow such a disaster is still the rule in the Arab world, rather than the exception. Yes, Mr. Dittus, I admit that I am guilty of injustice in the Nliddle East, just as any other nation has been guilty of participating in any other war, and has been guilty of the inevitable results of such wars. However, this is hardic a reason to commit suicide.
