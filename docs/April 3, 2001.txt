"I wanted to prove that anybody can slate with ANY party regardless of what house or organization they are in," Fried wrote. "I did this with no intention to run -simply to make a point." Myers said he filed the appeal to Dean of Students Julie Sina because he said Fried is not qualified to run and she should have been disqualified. "It was not a reaction in-any way to the outcome of the election," Myers said, adding that he appealed the Masters' decision before the election. Myers said he was dismayed at the ruling and the comments by Vice Chancellor Josh Heller, who was acting as chancellor in the hearing. "We felt one of the problems with the board's hearing was they almost scolded us in reference to the timing of the complaints," Myers said. "That appeared to be biased against us from the .outset." Myers said another problem he had with the Masters' decision was that Fried was not disqualified even thoughthe board found she had endorsed SUN.

SUN appeals to overturndecision Members o party request barring of election validation By Joe Black Alligator Staff Writer Students Unite Now presidential candidate Gil Sanchez filed an appeal Monday to have Dean of Students Julie Sina overturn a late-night decision by Student Government's highest court that -allowed the Senate, to continue 'with the validation of the Spring election. After hearing arguments Sunday night, the B of Masters upheld rulings by the Elections Commission that dealt -with possible validation problems c ncerning the close vote'-where Student. BodPresident-elect Marc Adler dA.* "$aSoez by 17 votes early The briefs state members of SUN are asking for a barring of the validation of election, a manual recount of ballots in the election and an order removing the votes of individuals who entered a raffle allegedly sponsored by the Fusion Party. They are also asking for either an invalidation of election results or a mandated runoff election. These arguments were brought before the Elections Commission on Friday and were shot down, forcing SUN members to appeal to the Masters. Sanchez nor his vice presidential running mate, Anna Shea, could be reached for comment on Monday. Sina said she hopes to make adecision on the case before .theSenate meeting tonight, but will not set a specific-time to rule. .Imtakin eve here, h -nder advisement. sheai. thiskIeelt ye it tOe timae ntsglk *4 said he would rather the administra-.. tion stay out of the SG judicial process as it has in the past. "It's supposed to be government by students and for students, and if the Elections Commission and the Board of Masters have made a ruling, then thatis what we should follow," he said. .If Sina does not take action, the Senate is expected to vote on the validation of the election results tonight at 7:30 -in the Reitz Union room.282. A majority of votes by the Senate is needed to-allow results to stand.

4 AL I0G&OR, TUESDAY APRIL 3, 2001 ie Essence of Motherhood Okisha doses off at Jordan's pediatrician's office. Okisha said she has learned to live on four hours of sleep a night. Okisha prepares a bottle of prune juice just before midnight V owaS stomach.

5 After a long day of school and motherhood, Okisha winds down with Jordan. Story 05Photos by Ryan Holloway It's 9 a.m., and Okisha Lowe already has given Jordan, her 2-month-old daughter, a bath, taken her to the doctor and droppedher off at Jewel's Little Rascals Daycare. Finally, about four hours after her day begins, she sits down to finish studying for her exam, which is in two hours. When the test is finished, Lowe thinks she did fine. But her day isn't over yet -not even close. Since she has the day off from work, Lowe has to make time for a trip to the grocery store before picking up Jordan from day care. Though the 20-year-old is successful at handling the responsibilities of attending Lake City Community College and holding a steady job, she says they do not compare in importance to being a mother. "When Jordan is picked up in the morning by the Department of Children and Families, instead of going back to sleep, I study," Lowe says. Since the age of 15, Lowe has been in the Independent Living program with the Department of Children and Families -a program th at shelters young adults who live without a family. The program gives her financial and emotional assistance. "Thank you, Jesus, for the Department of Children and Families," Lowe says. "They help me out a lot." She says the hardest part of being a mother is figuring out what is wrong with Jordan when she cries. "You have to do everything in the book to see what's wrong," Lowe says. That's just what Lowe does for her daughter -everything-she can. And the gratification that comes from motherhood, she says, is indescribable. "When we are up l&te at night, and I'm playing with her, and she's trying to talk to me, I talk back to her," Lowe says. "And I just watch her smile." On the job at Krystal fast food chain, Okisha receives orders from the shift manager. After dressing Jordan in the morning, Okisha gives her a big kiss.

The words 'No spicks [sic] for president!" were spray-painted across a Side of the institute visible from the street. The attack was directed at Gil Sanchez, a Colombian student who ran for student body president. However, the real victim of the attack was not just Gil but the whole community, Hispanic and otherwise. When hate-charged action such as this one. goesunpunished, or worse yet, ignored, the arm to our community's sense of decency is exponential. The most effective response to this sort. of~crime is not punishment against the criminal but rather information. Prejudice and stereotypes cannot be eliminated through legislation or through a system of retribution that in some ways engenders more resentment and ignorance. It is only through dialogue and exposure of misconceptions that we can combat -thisplague. But this cannot be accomplished If the voices coming forward to be heardgo ignored or are pushed to the fringe and called "troublemakers.' Even the Alligatoritself has helped to perpetuate -this "invisibility" of prejudiced groups.

8, ALLIGATOR, TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 2001 -7 Vw ...... Story & photos by Christina Stuart After a rainy week full of lightning storms and power outages, the Santa Fe Community College SpringArts Festival had blue skies and white clouds over the weekend. The 32nd annual festival showcased artists from all over Florida. Many artists traveled hundreds or even thousands of miles to display their works. Various forms of stained glass, photography, hand-made furniture, paintings and pottery were displayed on Northeast First Street in the shade of oak and palm trees. Some of the more unusual displays were flowers made of fish scales and creatures made of wire. But others had their own booths, selling hand-made crafts. Children were very involved in the festival, some creating their masterpieces on the Thomas Center grounds in the Kids Art Jungle. For livelier entertainment, 32 groups performed on two stages offering music and dances from all over the world. i4, *I k FLAG FOOTBALL TOU sew_.-"' IB /1 Lue l.dA.

Slip up caught on tape leads to arrest of two By Timothy Word Alligator Writer Two underage Jacksonville men were arrested after they were taped while acknowledging the presence of a marijuana pipe and unopened beer in their car while they thought they were alone in the back of a police car Sunday morning. The police officer who pulled the pair over forgoing 49 mph in a 45 mph zone andhaving an "extremely loud muffler" was recording the conversation, according to an arrest report. The officer was searching their car with their permission at that point. Christopher Daniel Williams, 20, and Geoffrey Michael Foster, 20, were arrested just after midnight when the officer found marijuana and open containers in their car while passing through Waldo, about 10 miles from Gainesville. After pulling over the car, Waldo Police Officer David Kirkland noticed some marijuana residue on Williams' pants and asked him to exit his car. Kirkland then told Williams what he had found, and Williams told him there was more marijuana in the car, according to the report. Kirkland asked Williams to sit in the back seat of his patrol car, while he asked Foster some questions about the marijuana, the report states. Foster told Kirkland he did not believe drugs were in the car, and with his consent, Kirkland asked him to wait in the rear of his patrol car with Williams while he searched their car. Upon searching the vehicle, Kirkland found two open containers of Icehouse beer on the floorboard of the car and two cases ofbeer in the trunk. He also found a small bag of marijuana and a marijuana pipe, according to the report. Williams' license was suspended but he denied any knowledge of the suspension to Kirkland, according to the report. While the two were sitting in Kirkland's car, they were recorded discussing how to explain the marijuana, the beer, the pipe and the suspension of William's license, the report states. The recording indicates Williams wanted to take the blame for the marijuana, while Foster would continue his denial, the report states. The recording gave Kirkland enough information to arrest and charge the duo with possession of marijuana less than 20 grams, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of alcohol by a minor, according to the report. Spencer Mann, spokesman for the State Attorney's Office, said recording people in the back of police cars is a common practice. "There is no expectation of privacy in the back of a police car," Mann said. "It's not unheard of that it happens all over the country." Alachua County Sheriffs Office spokesman James Troiano said his department has recorded conversations in police cars before and will continue the practice in the future. "Conversations have been recorded in the past and used against individuals in court," Troiano said. "It's a practice that does occur here at the sheriffs office." Foster and Williams were released from the Alachua County Jail on their own recognizance.

"He really taught me a lot growing up," Catalanotte said. "He's basically the reason Iplay*&baselia&11." One thing "hik'ather has taught Catalanotte is that there is a lot of luck involved in the gameof baseball. Slowed by a quadriceps injury at the as encouraged him th Rockies' spring training camp in Tuc-son, Ariz., Catalanotjoehas not had thebest of luck this spring. The injury kept the switch-hitting'..." outfielder out of games until the last--, couple weeks of spring training. Colorado farm director Mike Hill said the injurydid not affect Catalanotte's placement for the season. He will start the season in High-A Salem, VaA Joe Mikulik, who coached'-.4 Catalanotte last season when he played for the Low-A Asheville (N.C.) Tourists, worked with Catalanotte this spring_:: and said the sluggers fully recovered :from his injury. "He's at full-go and I'm. looking for big things from him," Mikulik said. "He's played in games and was swinging the bat well." The Arizona native delivered big things for Mikulik last season with the Tourists. In his first full season of professional baseball, after being drafted. by the Rockies in the eighth round-of : the 1999 draft, Catalanotte finidlied'third in the South Atlantic League with 20 home runs. He led his team with 75 RBI. "I had a great time playing every day and traveling, seeing a bunch of places you've never seen before," Catalanotte said. "I set some goals and wanted to hit at least 20 home runs so I was excited about that." After attending Glendale Junior College in Arizona, Catalanotte left for Gainesville in 1998. Despite playing just two years at UF, he is ranked sixth in UF history with 31 home runs. Catalanotte said UF coach Andy Lopez used his "West Coast connections" to recruit him. Lopez, who S.w thal #iYa quadriceps injury, former Gator Greg1jataano~tte s*iMis. top prospect in te Colorado Rockies' farm system. coached at Pepperdine in California before coming to UF in 1995, said Catalanotte played a big role on UF's 1998 team that went to the College World Series. "He definitelywas instrumental in getting us to Omaha that year," Lopez said. "He was really intense at the plate and put some pretty good strokes together at the plate." If Catalanotte continues to hit with power, he has a clear path through the Colorado organization, Hill said. "Our strength is pitching," Hill said. "No one is in his way as long as he con tinues to improve." While Bill Catalanotte never had th, chance to play in the maj6ks, he is hoF ing his son will. "I guess I'm somewhat living m: dreams through him because he's gei ting a chance to do the things I. neve hag a chance to do," he said. "I'm jus eating it all up."

My first memory, however, will not be the looks of the course inside, but what surrounds the course outside. Just a few blocks from this Mecca of golf iaslwand talent are a slew of resitaumnts;,stripmalls and hotels similar to Archer Road in Gainesville.

Coach Steve Spurrier instituted a new scoring system this spring to make practices a little more competitive. On Monday, he took the intensity a step further. Spurner brought the offense-to Florida Field while the defense remained at Sanders Practice Field, separating the two squads with 30 minutes left in practice. The offense, which lost Saturday's scrimmage 30-11 after winning the first two, is looking to surprise the defense in today's final spring scrimmage. "We have a whole bunch of trick plays ready ... so we practiced apart," Spurrier said. "They can pull out anything they want, the offense can pull out anything they want." Today's scrimmage will begin at 5 p.m. at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, and Spurrier said it will feature "real football." "It's first team versus first team," Spurrier said. "We are not going to play those guys that don't know what to do. They're going to be spectators. So it's going to be a real ballgame. "The defense is pumped up and hopefully the offense will be ready to play well." Spurrier said there will be no substitutions in the scrimmage, with the starters playing until they get tired. Haugabrook has surgery Wide receiver Brian Haugabrook underwent knee Sophomore Rex Grossman and the UF offense practiced separate from the defense Monday in preparation for today's scrimmage. surgery Monday to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Haugabrook was injured at the end of practice March 22. Team physicians said Haugabrook may return early next season. Haugabrook is part of the growing list of injured Gators this spring. Cornerback Lito Sheppard is out with a pulled left hamstring. Defensive end Kennard Ellis has a ligament tear in his left thumb. Fullback Rob Roberts has an ACL injury and may need surgery, guard Thomas Moody has a sprained left elbow and running back Ran Carthon separated his shoulder. Depth charts taking shape Heading into today's scrimmage and Saturday's Orange and Blue Game, it looks like Taylor Jacobs has secured his spot as the No. 3 receiver behind Jabar Gaffney and Reche Caldwell. "Taylor might be as good as Reche right now. Reche has had a so-so spring," Spurrier said. Also, with Roberts' injury, Spurrier said freshman walk-on Ray Snell will be the starter at fullback today and Saturday. No video allowed With both sides using their entire arsenals, Spurrier wants to ensure none of his plays are leaked to opponents. No video cameras will be allowed in the stadium for today's scrimmage or the Orange and Blue Game. "We don't need people videotaping our practices and shipping them up to Knoxville and places like that or else we have to go back to closing practice," Spurrier said. "I don't mind if they come and take pictures of the guys, but no video." Seth Traub can be reached at straub@alligator.org Gylmasts eager for Regionals to begin By Jeff Dadingta Aioatr Writer With less than a week until the Re-* gional Championships, the Gator gym-iastics team has dedicated its past several practices to perfecting routines and sticking landings. But the workouts are not what have beenwearing on the Gators lately. It's the waiting. "We're just Wei. We .eedto&o do -nsome ways, beca w ready. We #W.ndofite lnsifying this weekend, sepln z Gators WfOW h res come Regionals, they would have home-gym advantage. And after pulling an Olympic rotation in the draw among-the six Southeast Region teams, the competition will be even more like their regular-s'easn home meets. The Olympic rotation follows the same order of events the Gators have used at their other home meets. The Gators will start on vault, have a second-round bye and then move to uneven bars. For the final half, they will continue with beam, have another bye and fish on floor. 0I love that draw,, Sophomore Lindsey Minersaid. 'It's great to end on floor, especially with a home crowd." Mp t aw I ku~ position may have rewarded them with a better shot at advancing to the NCAA Championships. Saturday's Regional will consist of six schools -three in the top 18 and three unranked. In each region, one school comes from the top eight teams, the next ranked between nine and 12 and another between 13 and 18. Because the Gators are locked in the No. 12 spot, only No. 2 Georgia will be ranked higher in the Southeast Region. Even with a loss to the Bulldogs, if the Gators can outscore No. 14 Iowa, George Washington and North Carolina State, they will advance to the national championship on April 19-21. The top two teams in each region advance. f effDarhn to can be reached at lob
