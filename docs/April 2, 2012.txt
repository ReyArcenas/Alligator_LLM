Then the forwarded messages came pouring in. When Perez took a closer look at his phone later in the day, each new text or email from one of his friends led to a story saying the 5-foot-8, 178-pound man he chased across three blocks was Erving Walker  UFs all-time leader in assists and the lone senior on this years team. Walker was arrested by Gainesville Police Department ors. He was not jailed and is scheduled to appear in court on April 19 at 9 a.m. I dont follow sports, Perez said. He was just some dude that stole who was very fast. According to Perez, Walker stopped at the Tacos Locos food stand across from Rockeys Piano Bar on South Main Street just before 1 a.m. and placed an order. As Perez, 26, prepared to receive payment like he has every day since setting up his stand last June, his co-worker Matt Hruska, also 26, quickly prepared a taco and gave it to Walker. He ordered a $3 sausage taco and then he was like, Do yall take cards? Perez said. But before either Perez or Hruska could reply, Walker allegedly took off with the taco and sprinted across Main Street toward Southwest First Avenue. So I looked at Matt and said, Dang, he just stole that. Should I chase him? and he was like, Yeah, Perez said. Perez said two other tall men accompanied Walker to the stand, but neither tried to stop what was happening and began to slowly walk behind him as Walker ran.Vendor provides account of Walkers alleged taco theft SEE TRUSTEES, PAGE 5 TYLER JETTAlligator Staff WriterA UF student who was hit by a semitrailer last week remained in critical condition at Shands at UF on Sunday.

CLARE LENNONAlligator Staff WriterMatt Michel didnt set out to make a name for himself. Breaking a national record  twice  was never the goal. On Sunday in the Stephen C. OConnell Center, he became the longest-running Dance Marathon charity participant in the country, two times over. Out of thousands of dancers at more than 150 schools nationwide that raise money for Childrens Miracle Network Hospitals through DM, Michel is the only one who has made it to nine years at the annual event, smashing his previous record of eight years in 2011. On Saturday and Sunday, he and 810 other dancers stood for 26.2 hours straight. They learned the annual line dance, hoops. Every few hours, they listened to patients families talk Michel said the stories make the event meaningful and keep him coming back. Thats what makes it different than, say, beach cleanup, he said. with his fraternity pledge class, he didnt know much beyond a video he saw of the group line dance. It seemed fun, and hed be with friends  why not? Now, he is a veteran dancer, with favorite line dances and favorite moves. The dance to Journeys Any Way You Want It is one of his favorites, and he prefers high-energy dances with transitions between song clips. changes, supportive shoes and a study spot near an outlet. He wore orange-and-blue plaid board shorts  board shorts are comfortable, and bright colors keep him alert. The shorts also match his Cheeto-orange hair. He has raised $300 to $400 each year for a total of about and he hopes to visit DM after he graduates. The participants and organizers from Michels undergraduate days are already at that stage. Michel might not know some of the younger crowd, but the older participants and staff members still stop to shake his who is also Michels fraternity great-great-great-great-grandlittle brother stopped to chat. Then two friends brought him a smoothie, and when they left, a staff member asked how hes holding up. Kenny Brighton, the overall director of DM at UF in 2010 and 2011, used to be one of those people. He said Michels been dancing in DM so long that he was allowed to use private rooms reserved for staff members, which is how they met. Now he cant imagine DM without Michel. Staff members check months ahead to see who has signed up, and seeing Michels name on the list helps the staff feel like they will be able to pull off a successful event. We all know everythings going to be right with the world after that, Brighton joked. Hes usually visible at the event, but in hours 23 and 24, Michel sticks out for more than his height and his hair. People are dragging a little bit, Brighton said. But Matt Michel is always excited, always contagious. That reputation has lasted, even when Michel should not have been standing at all. In 2009, his ankle was double its usual size, iced and wrapped in bandages. He completed the 26.2 hours on crutches. stood  and very often leaned. He rolled his ankle when he fell off a rock-climbing wall, and he stayed off his foot as much as possible so he could still participate in DM. He won the Jen Krug award that year for the most outstanding dancer. It was his sixth year, which tied the school record. Michel said nobody was really sure what the national record was, but people started wondering around his seventh that eight years in a row was a record. Now he has one year left at UF before he moves to South Florida, where he hopes to practice immigration law. Hes been at UF for almost a decade earning bachelors degrees in Spanish and history, masters degrees in international business and history, his law degree and doctorate degree in Spanish. Cecily Welsh, a third-year law student who has worked with Michel on the UF Supreme Court, said Michel applies his DM commitment to every area of his life. He asks thoughtful, pointed questions in his law classes, teaches an undergraduate Spanish course, is a member of Florida Blue Key, has worked in all three branches of Student Government and still goes out of his way to get to know his peers, she said. Hes involved with 16 times more things than youre doing, she said, laughing. As Michel approaches the end of his college career, he has to decide whether he will participate in his usual activities and whether he will go for a decade of DM. Michel sealed his nine-year record when he sat down at 1:42 p.m. on Sunday. But as he marked the end of DM, he knew it might be for the last time.

Allen, whose stage name is Angel, made plans with Mieras on Thursday afternoon while she was working at Cafe Risque, a Micanopy strip club famous for its red-and-yellow We Bare All billboards. The two had never met before Thursday, Mieras said, but Allen told him she would swing by his hotel room after she got off work. She arrived at Room 224 at the Micanopy Inn at about 10 p.m. Thursday but soon walked away, telling Mieras she would be back in a minute. She left the door open. Then, Angelo, Foreman and Williams walked into the room. Angelo carried a black shotgun. He told might kill him. When Mieras tried to wrestle the shotgun from Angelo, one of the other two alleged robbers shocked Mieras with a stun gun. Mieras said he was shocked between 12 and 14 times, and his head is bruised from getting hit by the butt of the shotgun. The three suspected robbers then tied him up with ripped credit card, three months worth of pain-relief pills, an iPhone 4, $1,500 and a Tec-9 pistol with 12 bullets.

MONDAY, APRIL 2, 2012 ALLIGATOR, 7Letters to the EditorStudents should protest for the Syrian peopleEdmund Burke, an 18th-century Irish political theorist, once said, All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. True to this concept, the violent triumph of Bashar al-Assad, the current president of Syria, has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians (including countless young children, pregnant women and courageous journalists) in a bloodbath unprecedented in modern Middle Eastern history. And what have the good men done? Other than sharing alJazeera videos on Facebook, nothing. The obvious question arises: What can we do? After all, I have barely any money in my bank account (there goes the chance to donate to aid Syrian refugees) and even less (i.e. zero) political leverpolicy in the Middle East. The answer is bitter but a timetested one: Get yourself out on the streets. Change, from the time when the mobbed King Street in Boston in 1770 until today, has only come when our political and civic leaders realize that our emotions have transformed into a physical presence onto the streets and squares of a community. It is only when the common man or woman protests alone (as in the case where a Buddhist monk self-immolated himself at a road intersection in Saigon in protest of the religious persecution the Buddhists faced in South Vietnam in the 1960s) or with others (as in the case when Muslims and Christians joined hands in Tahrir Square, Cairo, last year) that the decision-makers are forced to bow down to such immense, almost supernatural popular pressure and change their wretched ways. This, my fellow Gators, is the way the world works. Dont expect that your reading of this letter or your sharing of a post will change the world a tiny bit. Genuine change requires physical work; whether it be going from door-to-door or gathering at a street protesting the brutality sanctioned by a government. Why? Not because I nor anyone involved in the humanitarian effort need you to come. The Syrian people dont even need you. Rather, your coming will simply quench the thirst your moral conscience has felt since you walked by, eyes cast down, ignoring the Salvation Army Santa Claus outside of Walmart last winter. Umair Asghar Mechanical engineering sophomore Unite Party fails to uphold promise of transparencyThe Transparency in Executive Agencies Act was an uncontroversial piece of legislation that would have increased transparency in the Accent Speakers Bureau and Student Government Productions. Both of these agencies receive almost half a million dollars of student funding each year. Transparency is a point that both parties had on their platforms during this past election season, but it is still not being realized in Senate. Simply put, the Transparency in Executive Agencies Act requires Accent to publicly release the names of those individuals who receive complimentary or VIP tickets, like those given for show two weeks ago. The release of these names used to be done on a regular basis by Accent chairmen and treasurers in the past but was inexplicably stopped two years ago. The current Accent Chairman, Corey Portnoy, claims the Student Senate does not have access to these lists because all tickets are complimentary, but I ask you, as a student, if you think this is fair. If you are waiting for a show hours before it starts and someone waltzes past you to special seating, arent you entitled to know who that is, especially when your activity fees pay for the shows? The Students Party attempted a promise of transparency to The Gator Nation, but this bill was not even discussed in Senate. The Judiciary Committee ruled that the bill should not be heard based on the vague idea of implication that the judiciary chairman himThis piece of legislature was struck down by six senators in a shady committee meeting so that no student would see Unite corruptly vote against it. The Unite Party message is clear: No transparency. Not now, not ever. The only way students can have an open and free government is by getting involved and taking action now. I urge all interested students to apply for open Senate seats, the cabinet positions that are opening in early April and positions in Accent, SGP and any other executive agency to put the students back into Student Government. Applications can be found at at the lower left-hand corner. Matt Pesek Student senator I know many of you are disappointed you did not win the $640 million Mega Millions jackpot over the weekend. Dreams of never working again, living the high life and naming UF after yourself are gone forever. However, when I read that the winner will owe $161.7 million in federal taxes, it got me thinking about the injustice of Tax Day. The usual response I hear from my progressive friends about the alternative minimum tax, lottery, gift, estate and other not affecting me taxes is that we should heap them on like ice cream. After all, the people earning the windfall did nothing to deserve that money. Therefore, it should be redistributed to everyone, since random chance gave them an unfair lump-sum payment. To look at why this mentality penalizes the top 10 percent way more than the top 1 percent, lets compare the three winners of the Mega Millions lottery to a surgeon making an annual income of $500,000. To make the comparison easier, lets assume that the doctor and the lottery winners all live in New York City. The mega millionaires will owe a total of $199.5 million in taxes. Assuming a combined tax rate of about 12 percent in NYC and a federal income tax rate of 35 percent, the doctor takes home $286,000. One also has to account for about $6,000 in Social Security tax and maybe $6,000 in Medicare taxes under the new tax rules passed by the Obama White House, leaving our surgeon with $274,000 in take-home pay. If we assume $5,000 per month for rent/mortgage and $5,000 per month for private school tuition for two children, the surgeons salary is down to $154,000. Take away another $5,000 per month for food costs for the whole family and $5,000 per month for insurance costs, transportation, utilities and miscellaneous expenses, and we are down to $34,000 per year to spend lavishly. Some will say that the problem with my example is that the lottery winners should pay 75 percent in taxes and the doctor should be allowed to just pay 25 percent. The issue is not the progressiveness of the tax code, but that it takes a huge bite out shape. The lottery is a somewhat special example, but think of people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerburg. All of these men essentially won an even bigger lottery by creating incredibly useful products for the entire world to use. These guys probably had some of the best lawyers and accountants in the world characterize their incomes as long-term capital gains so they could get that 15-percent tax rate. Meanwhile, the surgeon is working 70-hour weeks transplanting organs and gets hit with the 35-percent tax rate. Warren Buffett wants to increase the drastic difference between the takehome pay of money managers and heart surgeons. By raising income taxes to 39.8 percent, we would force real-world people who dont drive Bentleys or shop at Tiffanys to make tough choices like pulling their kids out of their preferred school, lowering malpractice insurance or moving to a cheaper residence. These can all be valid decisions, but they shouldnt be forced by a change in the tax code. The metaphorical lottery winners of the world pay a large amount in taxes, but they can afford the best help money can buy to legally avoid as much tax as possible. This reality will always be the case, and the rich will become better at dodging taxes as they increase. It is clear there is a direct relationship between income tax rates and effort spent on not paying them. When the lottery winners die, their heirs will receive hundreds of millions, but they probably wont pay the full 35-percent death tax because of their professional armies. Meanwhile, the surgeon who saved up several million over a lifetime of tough, long weeks will have to fork over the full 35 percent above the $5-million exemption because that person was probably a lot more attentive to saving peoples lives than to In life, we shouldnt punish the lottery winners or the whitecollar workhorses. Low taxes encourage entrepreneurial risk and create more social justice through long-term growth than any redistributive program. At the rate Washington is spending money, Im just glad income taxes arent already at 100 percent. Travis Hornsby is a statistics and economics senior at UF.

SHELBY WEBBAlligator WriterSANFORD  The rise and fall of the crowds cheers almost drowned out the speech as Marie Dino and Chrisley Carpio watched the stage from a crowded grass lawn. The Rev. Al Sharpton told those gathered in Sanford that protesting didnt make them extremists, it made them heroes. We are not the troublemakers, he said. We are the troublebreakers. Carpio and Dino, both 20-yearold UF students, shouted in agreement. About 30 UF students joined more than 3,000 demonstrators in Sanford on Saturday to demand the arrest of George Zimmerman, 28, and the permanent removal of Sanford Sheriff Bill Lee. These calls come more than a month after Sanford police said Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Police said Trayvon was walking home, unarmed, on Feb. 26, when Zimmerman called police and told them he was following a suspicious-looking person. The two fought, and Zimmer man shot and killed Trayvon. Zimmerman told police he acted in self-defense. Zimmerman hasnt been ar rested, partly because of Floridas Stand Your Ground law, which gives citizens the right to use deadly force in self-defense if they are attacked in a place they have a right to be. Florida is one of 24 states with similar self-defense laws  statutes that have been called into question in the aftermath Trayvons death. Since then, protests have erupted in cities across the state. Gainesville has had at least two in the past week. When the protests started in the town where Trayvon was shot, UF Students for a Democratic Society members decided they had to be a part of it. Dinos mint-green VW bug cruised through the UF campus at 8 a.m. Saturday. She and Carpio picked up Eric Brown, 18, and Alexa Kristensen, 19, from Turlingtrip to Sanford. Dino and Carpio said they learned how to keep protests peaceful and how to reach out to the media from older members of SDS. The student activist organization protests issues ranging from immigration to tuition. People think activists just yell to yell, but its not true. What we do is very structured, said Dino, a member of SDS and an education sophomore. She said people dont see their work off the streets, which includes negotiations, planning and writing news releases and proposals. We dont expect results over night, said Carpio, a history sophomore and organizer for SDS. You need a lot of patience. Dino and Carpio are no strangers to the protest scene. They said SDS has held rallies against block tuition and Univer sity Police after police shot an inAdu-Brempong, on March 2, 2010. The size of those protests paled in comparison to the one at Sanford. Walking up to the demonstration, what looked like a gray mass slowly became thousands of protesters waving the now-iconic black-and-white image of a hooded Trayvon. Those gathered ranged in age  some came in strollers, while others pushed walkers. Some brought entire families. Civil rights leaders including Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, surrounded by marshals at the front of the crowd, led a march to the Sanford Police Department. Slowly, the congested crowd when leaders of call-and-follow cheers exhausted their voices. Along the protest path, shops with run-down brick walls were closed. The streets were littered with onlookers and people selling food. Some pushed shopping carts full of T-shirts reading Justice for Trayvon and sold them for $10 each. One man, 56-year-old Frank Moore, drove from Columbia, S.C., to Sanford to sell his shirts at the rally. The crowd grew more enthusiastic as the Sanford Police Department came into view. Sharpton and Jackson spoke in front of the department, along with various pastors and representatives from the NAACP. Between speakers, UF students yelled, The people united will never be divided. An older woman stopped the group and told them they were saying the words wrong. Its the people united will never be defeated, she said. Because when were together, theres nothing we cant do. Some with the UF group wore hoodies, which have become symbols of the movement. But by the end of the protests, Carpio regretted her wardrobe choice. Maybe the thick hoodie was a bad idea, she said, smiling and wiping sweat from her brow.

Vote online at alligatorSports.org.Womens golf takes third during weekendLed by Andrea Watts 3-under 69 on Sunday, Floridas Murphey Collegiate Classic in Athens, Ga., this weekend. BRYAN HOLTAlligator Writer For once, it wasnt the Gators celebrating. When Preston Tuckers ninth-inning throw home sailed wide of catcher Mike Zunino, Rebels sophomore Bobby Wahl crossed home plate, starting a team-wide mixture of celebrating and taunting that prompted Ole Miss coach Mike Bianco to apologize to UF coach Kevin OSullivan. son. Well have to learn from it, OSullivan said. We made plenty of mistakes. Its disappointing but theres nothing we can do about it now. there had been talks of a tie. Sundays inning regardless of score because of a travel deadline for the Gators. Another inning would not be started after 4:45 p.m. Instead, there was a decision, and it was a 7-6 loss for No. 1 Florida (24-4, 6-3 Southeastern Conference) at the hands of No. 16 Ole Miss (20-8, 5-4 SEC). The day began as rough as it ended for the Gators. Sophomore righty Jonathon Crawfords run of good fortunes ended as he was pulled after just 1.2 innings.

JOSH JURNOVOY Alligator Writer After a quick start on Sunday, Penn State got physical. The Gators made them pay for doing so.

Coach Amanda OLeary said she Gators put up 20 in ALC win against Penn StateVan Overbeek UF Lacrosse Tucker SEE LACROSSE, PA GE 16 SEE TENNIS, PA GE 16TENNIS ELI MARGERAlligator Writer Bob van Overbeek watched as his opponents shot slowly bounced in front of him. The junior set his feet, brought his racket back and blasted a thunderous forehand past his helpless opponent. That was a recurring theme on Sunday not just for van Overbeek, but for all of the No. 11 Florida (12-7, 5-3 Southeastern Conference) beat Alabama in a 7-0 sweep, the teams third win in a row. Just as the regular season is winding down, the Gators are beginning to play their best tennis. Perhaps most important for Florida has been the resurgence of van Overbeek, the teams top singles player. After a stretch in which he lost match after match to challenging opponents, he has been able to assert himself and play his best tennis of the season during the last two weeks. Whenever he can win some matches, especially when you beat guys as good as dence, coach Andy Jackson said. He did some good things when he wasnt winning, and so did we as a group. The most impor doing some good things. This weekend, van Overbeek played dominant tennis, using a big serve and explosive forehand to overpower his opponents. He won his match Friday against Auburn on an ace, and was judicious in the use of power shots on Sunday. It has been somewhat of a change for him, as earlier in the season he was waiting for shots to create themselves rather than making his own offense. That mentality shift has been contagious throughout the team. Floridas players have been more aggressive across the board, putting points away to save their energy. But that formula has only in the last few matches yielded positive results. Poll ResultsShould A.C. Leonard have to face further discipline before playing this season?77% YES 23% NO30 total votes

14, ALLIGATOR MONDAY, APRIL 2, 2012 PREVIEWING THE ORANGE AND BLUE DEBUT With the Gators annual spring game, the Orange and Blue Debut, scheduled for Saturday at 1 p.m., we at alligatorSports want to get you prepared. Each day this week, we will give you a new piece Today, we look at the receivers, the red-zone offense and Will Muschamps second season at the helm. SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR DURING SATURDAYS GAME: 5. Wide receivers/playmakers Last season, Florida struggled to get the ball in the hands of anyone not named Jeff Demps or Chris Rainey, especially in the passing game. Rainey led the team in receptions and the Gators do not return a wide receiver who had more than 20 catches last season. Quinton Dunbar has been called out by coach Will Muschamp, who is looking for the sophomore to step up and lead the receiving corps. Andre Debose returns from a season in which he showed and JaJuan Story also will factor into the mix. Tight ends Jordan Reed, A.C. Leonard (should he return) and Kent Taylor also have potential. But theres one common denominator across the board: None of these Gators are proven. Regardless of whos throwing Saturday, focus on the play outside the numbers. Can the receivers get open and create separation? Are they crisp coming out of their breaks? And, most importantly, can they catch? AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: 5. Red-zone offense son ago, Muschamp and former offensive coordinator Charlie Weis would have enjoyed a much more successful season. The Gators made it to the red zone just 37 times and scored touchdowns on only 48.65 percent of their opportunities, rank (52) and touchdown percentage (74.29). Florida lost four games by 14 points or fewer last season, and with inexperi ence at quarterback regardless of who wins the starting job, close games are again likely this year. Can the Gators turn it around in one season? If so, it could be the difference between several more close losses and a second straight disappointing season or a few signature wins and a return to a BCS bowl.Pease Dunbar STORYLINE TO WATCH: 5. Year 2 under Muschamp By all accounts, the situation Muschamp entered a season ago was far from optimal. But now Coach Boom has had a year to instill his ways on the program, and history dictates that a head coachs second season is when the judgment can truly begin. Muschamp has Nation will start to see if Muschamp has laid the proper foundation for a restoration project designed to bring the program back to national prominence. Expectations shouldnt include a it was embarrassing at times to be a Gators fan last season. Muschamp knows that has to change.Muschamp Alligator StaffOSullivan: It is disappointing how we played in certain situationsWe just didnt get a good start from Jonathon, OSullivan said. But as it has done for most of the season, the UF offense bounced back. Florida erupted in the fourth inning, racking up four runs on RBI hits from Nolan Fontana and Justin Shafer, as well as a solo home run by senior Daniel Pigott. Things kept rolling in the sixth and seventh innings when Fontana and Preston Tucker each hit a solo home run to give the Gators I was pleased with the way we swung the bats, OSullivan said. I thought we battled like heck and I felt really good about the game. Unfortunately we had a couple mistakes there at the end. Battling both travel plans and an Ole Miss team that tied the game at 6-6 in the bottom of the seventh, Florida brought in closer Austin Maddox. He didnt allow a hit until one out in the ninth when Gainesville native Will Allen singled to right on a ball OSullivan said he thought Tucker should have caught. Then, after another single and an intentional walk, Tucker moved in from right freshman Senquez Golson dribbled a ball Tuckers way, the senior could not make the play. It was GolRBI of the year. Im proud of our guys for battling back, but it is disappointing how we played [Sunday] in certain situations, OSullivan said. Ole Miss took the series behind a dominant pitching performance by Wahl on Friday. Florida was able to avoid a sweep when it scored six runs in the eighth inning of Saturdays game en route to a 9-4 win. A radio broadcast contributed to this report.

With each basket counting one point, Stewart said he spotted his daughter three points in He wasnt so generous in the rematch, spotting Allen zero points and beating her again. However, Allen was not deterred. She said, I want to play again! Stewart said.

She said growing up in Mechanicville, a rough neighborhood, was, at times, a struggle. she was working like two jobs here and there just trying to provide, Allen said.
