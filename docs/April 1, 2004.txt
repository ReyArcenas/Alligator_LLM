By JUSTIN HEMLEPP Alligator Staff Writer jhemlepp@alligator.org More than 800 students gathered in a spontaneous but peaceful sit-in at Tigert Hall Wednesday morning responding to an emergency decision retroactively to increase tuition. The UF Board of Trustees' latenight decision Tuesday was approved by both UF President Bernie Machen and the Florida Legislature, which was in special session to debate secession because of former national counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke's recent allegations against the Bush administration. The proposal's passage increased undergraduate tuition $29.54 per credit hour. Graduating seniors taking 15 hours now must pay $443.10 by April 20 in order to walk with their class. Underclassmen must pay the increase before they register for another semester at UF. In a press release, UF administration officials indicated a "fierce effort" to nix the proposal from the Trustees' agenda was unsuccessful. The National Enquirer reported Machen wept as he signed off on the Trustees' decision. "Retroactive what? Can we do that?" he reportedly asked while reading the decision dated April 1. As Student Government officials spoke to the crowd -steadily gathering along 13th Street on the Tigert Hall lawn as word of the approved increase spread through campus -a group of more vocal protestors suggested speeches were not conference with Leak, and sources ion believe that his persuasion could :iding factor that led to the quarterer boarded a flight traveling from furt at 5 a.m. and Leak is expected to idquarters shortly upon landing.

2, ALLIGATOR U THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 2004 News Today OPEC agrees to cut output target; analysts see higher oil prices ahead VIENNA, Austria (AP) With fuel costs already at uncomfortable levels for consumers, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries took a step that could push prices even higher by announcing Wednesday it would cut its crude-oil production target by 4 percent. OPEC hopes the cut, which takes effect Thursday, will prevent a slide in prices this spring, when the global demand for oil usually slips to a seasonal low. Some analysts said the cut soon could push crude prices above the psychologically important threshold of $40 per barrel, though futures markets fell on Wednesday. The decision also could worsen the pain for U.S. motorists, who have been paying the highest prices in recent years for gasoline.

The ruling by the International Court of Justice could mean a reprieve or another chance of appeal for dozens of Mexican prisoners. It also could have implications for other foreign citizens who were not told they could receive help from their governments and are being held in U.S. prisons. The State Department has not responded to the ruling, and officials in Oklahoma and Texas, where three of the Mexican inmates are on death row, said no immediate action was being taken in those cases.

Although the court specifically dealt with the cases of roughly 51 Mexicans, it cautioned the principle should apply to all foreigners imprisoned for serious crimes. There currently are 121 foreign citizens on U.S. death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, and 55 are Mexican. It would be wrong to assume the court's conclusions "in the present judgment do not apply to other foreign nationals finding themselves in similar situations in the United States," the ruling by a 15-member panel stated.

You Decide. THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 2004 Iraq strikes kill nine Iraqi mob drags bodies in streets THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FALLUJAH, Iraq -In a scene reminiscent of Somalia, frenzied crowds dragged the burned, mutilated bodies of four American contractors through the streets of a town west of Baghdad on Wednesday and strung two of them up from a bridge after rebels ambushed their SUVs. Five U.S. soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division also were killed when a bomb exploded under their M-113 armored personnel carrier north of Fallujah, making it the bloodiest day for Americans in Iraq since Jan. 8. The four contract workers were killed in Fallujah, a Sunni Triangle city about 35 miles west of Baghdad -scene to some of the worst violence on both sides of the conflict since the beginning of the American occupation a year ago. Chanting, "Fallujah is the graveyard of Americans," residents cheered after the grisly assault on two four-wheel-drive civilian vehicles left both SUVs in flames. Residents in Fallujah said insurgents attacked the contractors with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades. After the attack, a jubilant crowd of civilians -none of whom appeared to be armed -gathered to celebrate, dragging the bodies through the street and hanging two of them from the bridge. Many in the crowd were excited young boys who shouted slogans in front of television cameras.

4',ALtfUATOEU THURSDAY, APRHJ-IL 2004 Fans sign petition decrying ticket-lottery system ONE UPSET FAN STARTED THE ONLINE PETITION. By CORRINE MULLINS Alligator Contributing Writer Football season isn't for another five months, but some students already are upset. Trying to win a lottery to get football tickets has led one UF student to start a petition. Self-proclaimed, die-hard Gator fan Bryan Kelley, 20, started an online petition addressed to the University Athletic Association after a friend mentioned the idea to him. "I was really pissed off that they were doing a lottery system," Kelley said. He said there is not a specific number of signatures needed to make a change in the lottery system, but he now has more than 1,300. Kelley said he told UAA officials why he thinks the new system is a bad idea, and he said they agreed with him. He said the officials told him it was BellSouth that had a problem with the old system. According to the UAA, BellSouth said people weren't able to dial 911 in Gainesville during the time people were calling for football tickets. Elizabeth Wilson, a UF student and a season-ticket holder for the past two years, said the UAA had bad timing for students but good timing for them. Wilson said the UAA instated the lottery just before everyone left for Spring Break, so there was no way students could do anything about it. Wilson, who also went to the UAA to complain about the lottery, said she was told Student Body President Kyle Jones was part of the decision to implement the lottery. Kelley and Wilson said they think the lottery system is the worst possible option, and the phone system was much better. "Anyone can register for the lottery," Kelley said.

Am FAPH I W UF worker retires 'after 23 years Co-workers share thanks, praise By KRISTEN KRIDEL Alligator Staff Writer kkridel@alligator.org UF's Wizard of Oz, who ran the president's office from behind a curtain for. nearly 20 years, retired Wednesday, said Jack Battenfield, director of Research Programs/ Services. Key administrators, such as President Bernie Machen and Athletics Director Jeremy Foley, gathered to wish Vera Hartsuch farewell at her retirement party Wednesday afternoon. Hartsuch, who has worked at UF for 23 years, sat down at Machen's request when co-workers stepped toward the lecture to share their gratitude and praise for the retiree. "What we're going to say will knock you off your feet," Machen said. Hartsuch had a hand in organizing commencement ceremonies, football games, receptions and luncheons, Battenfield said. "Our motto was, 'If you can't get it done from 9 to 5, work longer,"' he said. She knew the spelling of every graduate's name, who to invite to football games and the dietary restrictions of every official UF visitor, Battenfield said. "This university was a better place because of the respect Vera had for others," he said to the packed room in the University Auditorium. "When I think of Vera, I think of her natural grace ... She was a class act." Machen, clad in a baby-blue suit, presented Hartsuch with the President's Medallion. The President's Medallion is a 2 1/2 inch medal awarded for outstanding service or contributions to the university. This was the first President's Medallion Machen has distributed since taking office. Hartsuch deserves it, he said. She has worked with every president since Marshall Criser. "That's one of the nicest things ever," Hartsuch said of the award. "It's overwhelming." Hartsuch's daughter, Janet Perez, said her mother was worried no one would come to the party. Everyone at the party said they never had seen such a large turnout. "This university was a better place because of the respect Vera had for others. When I think of Vera, I think of her natural grace ... She was a class act." Jack Battenfleld director of Research Programs/ Services Five years ago, Hartsuch received a retirement countdown clock, coworker Lois Ivanko said. Hartsuch gleefully would announce the time she had remaining to anyone who would listen. "Today that clock runs out," Ivanko said. r Ivanko presented' Hartsuch with a new clock. This one had no hands and represented a timeless and stress-free retirement. "Every day is going to seem the same as yesterday," Ivanko said. Hartsuch said she plans to travel now that she will have some time for herself. "The president's office has been like a family," she said as she listed the names of her co-workers.

6, ;AAtIdA'O ltJRSjAY, APRt 1,dOr Editorial 1984 or 2004? Bush will protect Homeland from evildoers On this April 1, we endorse the Dear Leader, George W. Bush, for re-election. The Dear Leader has led the Homeland through times of trouble and crisis, and if the world is to become a safer place, we must give Him four more years -at least. If we do not, we place ourselves in grave danger. The Dear Leader has proven Himself to be a Man of His word, courageously leading the Homeland and battling off the cold-blooded killers and brutal dictators who close in on us like clouds in a gathering storm. The Dear Leader has shown the world that the Homeland is far superior to the lesser nations of the world. His refusal to bow down to the weak-kneed united nations shows his strength in a dangerous age. The eurocrats asked us to restrict the emissions of the greenhouse gases that power our mighty factories and to seek their permission before destroying our brutal foes. But the Dear Leader's voice thundered "No!" in the halls of the pathetic assembly of lesser nations. There are a myriad of reasons why we endorse the Dear Leader. We are good and dutiful citizens who wish strength to the Homeland. The Dear Leader is strong. After the horrific attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, He squandered no time in claiming the mantle of War President, with all the extraordinary powers the office provides. Would bill clinton have had the strength to lock up thousands of citizens on secret evidence with no access to lawyers or their families? We think not. The Dear Leader also has strengthened the economy of the Homeland. His economic policy gave us tax relief, because individual citizens of the Homeland know better how to spend their money than the government, especially when it comes to AIDS research and highway construction. To create jobs, he has freed up thousands of positions by removing reservists from them and sending them to protect the Homeland in a variety of god-forsaken hellholes. He also has outsourced many positions to lesser nations, whose cheaper labor allows our mighty corporations to expand without regulation. john kerry, on the other hand, is a dangerous Massachusetts flip-flopper who will raise our taxes to finance liberal plots such as providing immunizations to low-income children. When kerry was young, he betrayed the Homeland by speaking out against the Vietnam War, dangerously undermining the Homeland's national security. His dissent -in a time of war -is appalling, and his patriotism is suspect. Especially after the horrific attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the* Homeland simply cannot afford to entrust its national security to such a dangerous Massachusetts flip-flopper -who will raise our taxes. We must be united in our support of the Dear Leader, who has made the Homeland strong, The lesser nations of the world fear us, and rightly so. Woe unto those evildoers who defy the strength of the Homeland and incur its righteous wrath. But now the Homeland must do its part. We must re-elect the Dear Leader, or pay for our insolence in blood. May the Dear Leader ride to victory as we shout his slogan together -War is Peace, Slavery is Freedom, Ignorance is Strength. theaindependent florida alligators Cameron Ackroyd EDITOR Laura Merritt MANAGING EDITOR Sarah Anderson OPINIONS EDITOR Claudia Adrien, Warren Kagarise James VanLandingham Nick Weidenmiller EDITORIAL BOARD The Alligator encourages comments from readers.

This week has been particularly active. I was called into action Monday after readers were angered and hurt by Dale Griffin's Monday c6lumn about Islam. Concerned about the column's negativity toward the religion, about a dozen readers stopped by the Alligator to speak with me. Readers also e-mailed me to vent their frustration. Irate readers felt Griffin misrepresented Muslims and the history of their behavior by stereotyping them as a whole, based on isolated incidents from the past decade or so. These readers said Griffin was putting all Muslims into one category by combining political issues involving Palestine and Israel with the Islamic religion. All of the readers I spoke to noted every religion has isolated incidents, and no other religion ever is stereotyped-by those incidents. The group also said Griffin promoted hatred in his column, which made them fearful of retaliation by fellow students. They said the columnist made general claims and accusations, but he never-backed them up with facts. Readers who contacted me strongly believed the column was full of misinformation, and there was a total lack of support for any of Griffin's claims. One upset reader I spoke to said she feared ignorant people would look at her and feel she would want to kill them, because Griffin stated in his column that all Muslims want to kill people. Another reader was so angered by the column that she labeled Griffin's column "a terrorist act against us." Readers also were disturbed about Griffin's personal view that Islam is a religion of hate, while these readers maintain that Islam is a religion of peace. Many of the readers I spoke to demanded an apology The views expressed here are not Reader response Today's question: Did you play any practical jokes for April Fools' Day? from the Alligator and from Griffin.

This would ensure that Alligator advocate@alligator.org writers would not make any mistakes on sensitive issues on which they may not be well-informed. Readers also suggested the Alligator present both sides of sensitive issues together, as it often does with its "Viewpoints" section. By having both sides of a subject next to each other, readers would be able to decide for themselves which aspect they agree with, rather than having only one side presented at a time. Opinion writers frequently irritate and infuriate readers with their views. That is the inevitable result of taking a side in any controversy. A good argument typically is supported by enough facts to give readers a valid reason to.support that viewpoint. In the case pf Griffin's column, it is clear the writer has strong opinions, but it is equally clear readers find these opinions to be unsupported by specific, accurate documentation from the Quran and misrepresentative of the Muslim religion. However, Griffin maintains his interpretation of the Quran is correct. He will be available to chat with readers in an online forum next week. More information will be provided Monday in the "Viewpoints" section. Amy Perlman, a journalism senior, is the Alligator Readers' Advocate. necessarily those of the Alligator.

Others tied a yellow rope to a body, hooked it to a car and dragged it down the main street of the town. Two blackened and mangled corpses were hung from the green, iron bridge that spans the Euphrates River. "The people of Fallujah hung some of the bodies on the old bridge like slaughtered sheep," resident Abdul Aziz Mohammed said. Some corpses were dismembered, he said. The White House blamed terrorists and remnants of Saddam Hussein's former regime for the "horrific attacks" on the American contractors. "It is offensive. It is despicable the way these individuals have been treated," White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said. Referring to the planned June 30 transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis, McClellan said "the best way to honor those that lost their lives" is to continue with efforts to bring democracy to Iraq. State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said the contractors, all men, "were trying to make a difference and to help others." U.S. officials did not identify the dead or the nature of their work because the next of kin had not yet been notified. However, early evidence indicated they worked for Blackwater Security Consulting, a company based in Moyock, N.C., the company said in a statement. Abdel Kader Saadl / APr noto A vehicle burns in Fallujah, west of Baghdad, Wednesday. Residents said the gunmen attacked the two civilian cars. The vehicles were set on fire, and the occupants died. The security firm hires former military members from the United States and other countries to provide security training and guard services. In Iraq, the company was hired by the Pentagon to provide security for convoys that delivered food in the Fallujah area, according to the company statement' The abuse and mutilation of the contractors' corpses was similar to the scene more than a decade ago in Somalia, when a mob dragged corpses of U.S. soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu -eventually leading to the American withdrawal from the African nation. The images were broadcast worldwide and became the subject of the book and movie "Black Hawk Down." On Wednesday, a man held a printed sign wlmn aSK11diuL, 2,,,,ovbu.o b u ,iePnrase "'Tallujah is the cemetery for Americans" beneath the blackened corpses after they were pulled from the vehicles. One body was tied to a car that had a poster in its window of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the Palestinian militant group Hamas who was assassinated by the Israeli military in Gaza City. One resident displayed what appeared to be dog tags taken from one body. "It is offensive. It is despicable the way these individuals have been treated." Scott McClellan White House press secretary Residents also said there were weapons in the targeted cars. APTN showed an American passport near a body and a U.S. Department of Defense identification card belonging to another man. Some of the slain contractors were wearing flak jackets, resident Safa Mohammedi said. In Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt said the coalition would not be deterred from its mission to rebuild Iraq, and numerous reconstruction projects were moving forward nationwide, though attention was focused on the attacks. The roadside bomb that killed the five American soldiers Wednesday was in Malahma, 12 miles northwest of Fallujah, where anti-U.S. insurgents are active.

By JUSTIN HEMLEPP Alligator Staff Writer jhemlepp@alligator.org Armed with a large kitchen knife, a 13-year-old girl entered Westwood Middle School on Tuesday and threatened to cut the throat of another student, officials said. The seventh-grader brandished the weapon at several students while searching for a boy who, on Monday, shared aloud the contents of a note she wrote, said James TenBieg, Westwood's principal. The two engaged in a "verbal dispute" during the Monday incident, broken up by Westwood Resource Deputy Denise Scott, he said. The Alligator has chosen not to disclose the suspect's name, and officials have declined to identify the other students involved because of their ages. The girl -who's being held in the Alachua County Juvenile Detention Center -had just moved to Gainesville from Tallahassee, TenBieg said. She only had been at the middle school for 17 days. Two female students alerted Scott to the armed girl, who was standing in front of the deputy's office, and reported she wanted to "cut his throat," referring to the boy from Monday's dispute. Scott found the knife in a nearby garbage can, said Jim Troiano, Alachua County Sheriff's Office spokesman. The girl is charged in having a weapon on a school campus. No injuries were reported. TenBieg spoke proudly of the two girls who notifed Scott, and officials said they probably will be publicly awarded next week. ELECTION 2004 Green Party pres. candidate makes campaign trip to UF By GIANNINA SMITH 7 ljgator Contributing Writer In an appearance planned less than a week ago, students gathered in a Reitz Union meeting room to listen to the man seeking the Green Party presidential nomination. Wearing a Green Party button on his jacket, David Cobb told the audience he would concentrate his political efforts on local politics and expanding the party "I want to be part of an energetic campaign that is focused at the local level," Cobb said. Cobb became involved in politics while he was in college and worked for both Jesse Jackson and Jerry Brown when they sought the Democratic presidential nomination. "Let me share with you what I learned on those campaigns," Cobb said. "The Democratic Partypresidential primary process is the place where progressive politics goes to die." Cobb said he strongly opposes President Bush and believes he should not win the upcoming election. "He didn't win the [last] election," Cobb said. "George Bush was involved in what can only properly be called a judicial coup d'etat, and shame on Al Gore for not fighting for the election that he won." Cobb also calls for a change in the social, political and economic system of the country and said the Green Party is the only party that has a plan to change it. "The real problem is that this system has us on a suicide death march," Cobb said. Dave Chermak, the vice "I want to be part of an energetic campaign that is focused at the local level." David Cobb Green Party presidential candidate president of the Environmental Action Group at UF, said Cobb spoke well, and he now feels more informed about his position. "I am glad to see he is focused on local politics and building the Green party," Chermak said. But in the 2004 election, Chermak's vote may go elsewhere. "In the election, I am definitely going to support Kerry," he said. $ii 4."2 Lighted Tennis Courts -ape, .................. ..................

12, AbILIGATORMUTHURSDAY, APRfILt: 2004 How coming' out rectu By TWIGGY JOHNSON Detours Writer OK, I've gone and done it. I've actualized and made a few self-realizations. So, I think I'm ready to get on with this. I am ready to fess up. Ever since my encounter with a gender-challenged sex-worker (the nature of my confession lends itself to political correctness) outside a rundown shanty, I have noticed certain things about myself that somehow.. are different. My taste in clothing, my penchant for personal pampering, the attention my anus now receives ... none of these qualities were as pronounced before my corrupted coitus. What I failed to realize before, but gaspingly grasp now, is the actual impact this erotic encounter left on me. Well, I am ready to say it now: It left me gay. Yes, I am a reformed heterosexual. It is a choice, and now I too am able to proclaim loudly, whether through shouts or signs, "I'm here! I'm qdeer! Get used to it!" Only now, I'm starting to notice a few things about myself. First, I am unable to pronounce the letter "s." I never knew obtaining a lisp was requisite to being gay, but apparently it's in the "Big Book" somewhere (the unwritten book of the Chode, that is). Second, whenever I see any imal of myself, I primp and preen like a 1 year-old girl before a date with th sleazy guy voted "Most likely to 1 involved in a sexual-harassment suj by his senior class. I mean, I used to hate those kin of guys. You know, the type so full themselves they masturbate to mi rors? Now, I just compliment thE adorable, little hair flips and dari use of Neutrogena for Men. Finally though -and most won some -I noticed my sex drive has i creased. I think my count is up to 3 and I only have been gay for a wee Of course, I also have broken up fiN heterosexual marriages, caught a pa ticularly virulent case of ass-worn and cost a local pet store $300 in ge bil-location funds. At this point, I know you're askir yourself, "How? How can someor adopt so many stereotypical traits homosexuality in so little a time?" Well, to that I'll say simply thi It's April Fool's Day, none of this true and all the Conservatives o there bobbing their heads in submi sive foolishness to the sentiments "See, look what happens when tho: ass clowns get their way?" are stf narrow-minded, short-sighted, m0 ally-blind-despite-their-affectation of-character wankers.

THURSDAYdAPRILAm J2004's Florida artist depicts creepy, omirsn %eu By JOSH LEEPER Detours Editor Although religious fundamentalism and literalism are dangerous and clearly misguided in all cases, it also can be incredibly humorous. Some choose to dance around with poisonous snakes to show their love for God, others kill abortion doctors. Catholic priests take a vow of abstinence to show their relationship with God is pure and subsequently are driven to homosexual pedophilia. Perhaps you, dear reader, have difficulty appreciating the absurdity and irony of it all, but God would not. Earth is God's "blooper reel," the tape he invites his sarcastic friends over to watch, while enjoying beer and pizza. A particularly shiny gem of religious absurdity can be found at http://members.aol.com/Jesuskmages. Artist Larry Van Pelt of Niceville explains it best: "I was awakened in the middle of the night with a clear, vivid impression that the Lord wanted me to do some special drawings ... depicting ordinary people in their everyday environment ... with one important addition: the presence of Jesus Christ and His involvement in those routine activities." For Van Pelt to obey God's "command," he first had to learn to draw. After years of painstaking work, he drew up several sketches of people doing everyday activities, from a surgeon in surgery to a golfer golfing to a guitarist wailing on his acoustic axe. Then, he found a Jesus-looking model willing to grow a beard and who, "most importantly, was a devoted Christian." I don't understand the rationale there, especially because Jesus himself was certainly not a "devoted Christian." And I love how white people insist on images of a white Jesus. Logic dictates that Jesus would have sun-darkened Semitic features. Anyway, Van Pelt then proceeded to add Jesus to his drawings of ordinary folks -often without any attention to perspective and occasionally even forgetting to draw Jesus' legs -with the message "with you always." The fcanniest part are the jobs Van Pelt chose to illustrate -such as a forest ranger, an insurance agent and a clown -combined with the creepy smile on Jesus' face. It's as if he genuinely is enjoying the antics of the frightening down. Now, beyond the warm, vague notion that Jesus is "with me always," it raises a number of pragmatic concerns. Is Jesus hanging with the majority of the world (the nonChristians, still known in some circles as "heathens") waiting for them to let him into their hearts? Is he gawking leglessly behind prostitutes at work on their knees? When I'm at a Chinese restaurant, and I have to spit a piece of sweet and sour chicken into my napkin because the consistency is perplexing, is Jesus standing behind me, smiling? When a donkey-porn director spends a 14-hour day behind hot lights and piles of hay, does Jesus get bored and leave, or does he stick around "always?" I'm pretty sure if God or Jesus could see Van Pelt's web site, they'd strike him down with lightning or kill his first born son or something. I just hope that when I'm a ghost, I'll have time for something less trivial -such as scaring people and hanging around ladies' locker rooms -than standing around and smiling. In comparison, what would Jesus do? I can assure you, he'd do something more boring than what I would do if I had the power of Jesus. FAKE NEWS Campus preacher beaten within inches of afterlife BY JOSEPH DEMARCO 'Detours Staff He's wasted a whole day by shouting about Jesus until he' hoarse while lugging around his tall, cumbersome sign that lists all the neighbors he doesn't love. Somehow insulting not only everyone's intelligence, but also their lifestyles and all their friends has accomplished frustratingly little of the Lord's work. A campus preacher is taking a break silently to condemn the passing students in the harsh light of his condescending, superficial judgment when a-smooth pimp walks up to him and says flatly: "You'd calm the hell down and stop harassing people if you just got laid once in a while." Years of practice at yelling to sidestep contradictions allows the preacher to repeat: "I will never succumb to the passion of the flesh, and besides that I don't need a puppy." The pimp replies, "If you have second thoughts, I'm working a party at the Betta Tappa Kegga sorority house tonight. And if you're not too busy memorizing the Bible, you should come by and prove it." Now no matter the strength of his faith, any man reaches a breaking point when he's staring at the finely toned abs of a loosely robed statue of the crucified savior while crying on his knees with his-untouchable little tail between his legs in shame. So that night'he walks into the pimp's office, who asks "What are you into? Blondes, dominatrix girls, Chinese girls, Catholic school girls?" "Listen ye sinner, I'm not going to make sex with one of your evil harems. Prostitution is a sin, and I already told you, I don't want a puppy anymore." The pimp tells him to relax and that no one will know. God will know, thinks the preacher, but God has to forgive me anyway so he says: "Alright, I'll take an altar boy." Then a fnoment later, "What the hell do you mean you don't have any altar boys? Fine, give me a Catholic school girl with short hair." He walks into room No. 4 where a lovely girl waits on a bed seductively. "Hey handsome," she says, "so how dirty do you want your pickle tickled?" Though tempted, he turns that offer down and also one for dirty talk and a slob job because priests can't have sex. Before he can sermonize her, she says, "Look, a girl's got to make a living. Potentially good sex is a small price to pay for the freedom to buy what I want. You've never once had sex?" No, he's never given a girl the baloney pony, he has no use for a puppy now, but he did watch sex twice when he was a young boy. He explains: "When I was young my father and I were walking through the park and saw two dogs humping. 'Daddy,' I said, 'what are they doing?' And he says they're making puppies. A week later I walked in on my parents making love and I asked my dad what he was doing to mommy. He said they were making me a baby brother and to close the goddamn door.' "'Well, flip her over,' I said through the door, 'I'd rather have a puppy."' At that moment, two security gorillas burst in, dragged the campus preacher out back, and gave him the cockpunching of his life, but good God, it's better than nothing.

16, AtIGATORS THURSDAY, APRIL 1,2004 [hey guys, dont forget to type headline here, stat!] By LINDSEY M. STATHOPOULOS Detours Staff I'd likefib dedicate this article to my roommate and friend, lake McKenna. Today is the ote day of the year when all your bastard friends actuary get away with all the bullshit they pull on you every other day of the year. Hell, you might evenJoin in on the festivities and play a joke or two. i, for one, am planning on a series of elabo rate pranlfor the privileged few who are significant part of my life. I'm going up my roommate in the middle of and tell her our apartment is on fire mother is dead. The two really hay to do with each other. But I'm be so disoriented, she won't pi discrepancies in the story. I also am going to e-mail the last with that modem medicine is baffled "condition." Then, I'm going to call m. ents and tell them I'm pregnant. Afterward, I'll laugh and say I lost my scholarship and need about $400 so I can register for fall classes. That won't be a joke. This year, I had one wish I submitted to the April Fool's Day Fairy. I wished that upon awakening, Fool Fairy would be in my ,room telling me the past 20 years have been the most extrava history of foolery. My life, my direction The Fol Firy hen ouel pomeetotel who has counseled you?. ml ke you slave away at ajob enery andSlowly y tO get by? airy chuckle here), we ed one over on you! You've been ving someone else's life! Here's yours!" The Fool Fairy then would proceed to tell me I actually am a spoiled brat with a Lexus and owns every Vera Bradley ever made. I'd like to take this opportunity to make an aside comment: Vera Bradley is a genius and has played the best, most far-reaching prank on the world. (She's made obscene amounts of money exploiting the idiocy of sorority girls.) She's sitting on a beach in Honolulu, drinking LMai and laughing her ass off, do my winin to paycheck to pacheck. Apparently the Lindsey M. Stathopoulos doesn't have to dopate plasma, oh no. She has a credit card with no limit and never has worked a day in her life! Oh, you tricksters! The Fool would conclude his summary of the world's joke on me by saying those nights I cried myself to sleep because of a deep bout of depression -triggered by my empty love life -all were part of the prank Aww! Shucks, guys! Apparently, I actually am in love with a funny, sensitive, derstanding guy who's just plain good taste in music and art and Wi. me all night, nsup: aw ead and pull en gas girlfriend rrority sister. She'll don't say anything. y, and she thinks did, when you town. And n't believe. you, because hey, you told her -evenly 1 Hopefully, I'll be waking up to a brand new life that's been part of a lavish, grandiose joke the world has been playing on me all of my life. Because if that's not the case, I'm going to kill myself. No, I'm not kidding. Aspiring comic to crack up Coconuts Comedy Club By RYAN MAJOR Detours Assistant Editor Jimel Shannon, a 21-year-old comedian, wants you to know something. It isn't necessarily anything specific,aghe has untold numbers of jokes, stories and comedic mishaps in his "Yellow Notepad" (a purple, three-ring binder). But regardless, he will telf you -in his .own voice or one borrowed from the vociferous voice-box of a family member. And when he does, expect to be entertained, maybe even aroused. Shannon hails from Deltona, a not-quite suburb of Daytona. His first experience in entertainment came early, but proved fruitful. Titusville (McCurdy's), Jacksonville (Funnybones), Orlando (Bonkers), Tampa (Improv, at which he won two amateur competitions) and most recently, in Gainesville (Coconuts Comedy Club). So, what should be expected -comedy-wise -from the multiSince a senior project, in which faceted mulatto? Shannon performed a 20-minute "I like telling stories, the comset for his class, he has performed in' edy of experience," Shannon said. "I come from a mixed family, so racial differences are the funniest thing for me." Of course, if a crowd seems decidedly one-dimensional, Shannon isn't afraid to mix things up. "I have a pretty large base of jokes," Shannon said. "And I pretty much had to learn to tailor them to the crowd. For instance, at my last show at Coconuts, the crowd seemed older. I couldn't tell a 50 Cent joke, 'cause they wouldn't get the reference." Shannon has two shows coming up, one on Thursday and one on Saturday, both at.Coconuts Comedy Club on Newberry Road at the Holiday Inn. Get your ass out there to experience his innovative brand of "freestyle comedy" for yourself. ---~ .1 1

THURSDAYAPR1I, 2004 0 LOGY es so-so, Weezer still rocks The Vines Winning Days Capitol Records -In 2002, The Vines rode in from on a wave of publicnearly anyone even had r debut, Highly Evolved, everywhere already were hem the next great rock te decade -which they Evolved was over-hyped, I enjoy it for what it frenzied cluster of psyternative rock which, at led as if The Beatles and ere jamming together. f the same could be said Vines sophomore effort, Iys. If you've read the zilterviews with the band's stoned frontman Craig always is ranting about hundreds of songs writly to be recorded. If that re, then it's extremely hard to fathom how Winning Days is so at par with its harder-hitting predecessor. Much of what made Highly Evolved so enjoyable was its incoherence, which Winning Days severely lacks. The ultimate result is 40 minutes that seems more like a week -a peaceful, yet dull week. Weezer Weezer Geffen Records Right about now, you probably are saying to yourself, "Isn't that album about 1.0 years old? Isn't it a little too late for a review?" Well, yes it is. But this actually is a new-and-improved version of Weezer's classic debut (aka: The Blue Album). Now a double-disc deluxe edition, the re-release of The Blue Album is a 10-year anniversary done right. This is not one of those stunts meant to sucker consumers for every cent possible. Well, it kind of is, but my love for Weezer precludes me from expressing any reservations. The first disc is a remastered version of The Blue Album, which is a fancy way of saying it's the same as the original. The second is a collection of B2 sides, previously unreleased tracks and live versions of some of The Blue Album's best. Sure, most Weezer fans (myself included) have had these songs on our computers since the heyday of (free) Napster, but it's nice to have them in a tidy, collectable package. Some of the standout rarities you'll find on the second disc are studio and acoustic versions of "Jaime" and the tribute "Mykel and Carli," written about the Weezer Fan Club presidents who died in a car crash. This reissue is a must for Weezer fans, and though it's nothing new to most, it encapsulates a great moment in history for a great band. -JASON VENTURE urn't//WWW.Gtr-tIrAEGAV9R Introduce amwm awa I ing: Brand New, Luxurious Apartment Homes 2 Br 2.5 Ba Town Homes 2 Br 2 Ba Flats 3 Br 2 Ba Flats Now Leasing for FALL!

He's got a great career, a pregnant wife, and despite his unfortunate hairdo, things seem to be going very swimmingly for him. If you've read a single piece of news relating tc, this movie, then you already know that this pretty much goes to shit when his wife, the even more unfortunately named Gertrude Steiney-Trinke (Jennifer Lopez), dies during childbirth. Afterwards, Ollie (Ben Affleck) has something of a breakdown when faced with the pressure of raising his daughter alone in addition to his career. He insults the hell out of his client, Will Smith ("Yeah, like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air is ever gonna have a movie career"), and as a result, Ollie is banished from his field and sent to the cl est thing to purgatory they can find Jersey. One more thing, before I'm done ping the movie and move on to ac reviewing the thing, he moves back in his father, Bart Trinke (George Carli Seriously, where did these pe up with their names?

As a personal movie about fatherhood -ry and as a step towards bigger and more serious projects,, Smith has succeeded wildly dy here. But let's hope he never names any of Get up Kids on tour By JENN TRUMBULL Detours Staff Picture it: a clear April night in Tampa circa 1998, yours truly awaiting a show with friends at 408 Chaos Records. By day, the store was a hole in the wall that sold indie 7-inches, fanzines and band T-shirts. By night, it turned into a dive venue for bands coming through the bay area. Who did I see so many years ago on that *fine evening? None other than the Get up Kids along with Discount and Peterbilt. "I remember that show," said Jim Suptic, TGUK guitarist. "It was in a record store that could probably hold 20 people, but 100 people were packed in." Let's get back to present time. Believe it or not, it's 2004 and the Kids are not kids anymore. I caught up with Suptic (aka Dr. Jim, the guitarist of TGUK) about Guilt Show, Black Lodge recording studio and hitting the road after a brief hiatus with a nationwide club tour -all while juggling two successful side projects. "We own the studio, so it was relaxed -maybe too relaxed," Suptic said. The Kids purchased the Black Lodge in Eudora, Kansas with the budget they were allotted to create their fourth album on Vagrant nearly a year ago. The studio now is home to a long, impressive list of clientele, with Ed Rose taking the helm as one of the main producers. Rose helped craft TGUK's landmark album, Something to Write Home About, and contributed his producing talents once more on Guilt Show. "It took almost eight months, but it wasn't a painful process -more like three weeks in the studio then a month off," Suptic said. "With other members on tour, we recorded for months all over the map." The end result is Guilt Show, a wellcrafted album packed with the same sound that put TGUK on the map.Their latest collection of 13 toe-tapping tunes is the Kids at their best. "'Never Be Alone' is my favorite song on Guilt Show. It was written in a strange way -kinda pieced together," he said. Beyond the Kids' success, the group is a pool of talent with offspring, which includes the equally popular Reggie and the Full Effect, James DeWees' taco-loving baby and Matt Pryor's solemnly sweet solo-effort, the New Amsterdams. So, do the side projects affect the main gig? "I don't think so," Suptic said. "The New Amsterdams is Matt's acoustic solo thing and Reggie is in a whole other world. So, the projects are completely different from Get up Kids." The Kids are all grown-up. In fact, they are men in their late 20s. Not to mention three .out of five band members are happily married, with Pryor expecting a second child. Although, Suptic said the Pope Brothers are single and ready to mingle. "We call Robert and Paul the Nicky and Paris [Hilton] of Lawrence [City, Kan.], "Suptic said. "They are out on the prowl, partying. The Lawrence paparazzi are always all over them." "I don't get free beer anywhere in Kansas City," Suptic said. "OK, this one bar, but only because my wife cuts [the bartender's] hair. My wife is more recognized than I am." Partying and paparazzi aside, the Kids are hitting the road on a strippeddown club tour, with most of the dates sold-out in a matter of hours. "It has been almost a year since we have toured," Suptic said. "So, it,s nerve-racking, but we're keeping it old school. We're not pretentious -just some kids from the Middle West.": Couldn't have said it better myself.The Get up Kids, along with Recover and Rocky Votolato, are performing at the Social in Orlando Friday night. -Sl all ir i t ART Contemporary Photography from the Ham Museum Collection (Part I) through April 18 The Private Life of Sigmund Freud through April 11 Coming Home: American Paintings 1930-1950 from the Schoen Collection through May 2 Jacques-Henri Lartigue: A Boy, A Camera, An Era through July 18 THEATER Hippodrome (375-4477) -No Secret Anymore (cinema) -March 26April 1.

APRIL 1, 2004 UF FOOTBALL REPORT Spring allows for QB to learn By GREGG GIRVAN Alligator Staff Writer ggirvan@aIligator.org It is easy to get lost in the shuffle when your job competition broke most of UF's freshman passing records. As The Sporting News' Southeastern Conference Offensive Freshman of the Year, and with numbers like 2,167 yards, a 60.2 completion percentage and a pass efficiency rating of 134.8 for 2003, it's hard to imagine Chris Leak losing the starting job. However, as backup quarterback Gavin Dickey participates at baseball practice on most days, redshirt freshman Justin Midgett is getting the reps he needs to develop. "It gives him an opportunity to get a good feel for where he's at in the offense and for us to get a good feel for where he's at," UF coach Ron Zook said. While the crowd c spectators standing at each practice might see a player that is struggling, Zook quickly dismissed that notion. After all, it's Midgett's first s|ving like the other freshmen. "Even the freshmen who played a lot last year, it's their first spring," Zook said. LINE ON THE MIND: For the 2003 Freshmen Defensive Player of the Year, his job may become easier as each spring practice passes. Linebacker Channing Crowder feels the looming defensive linemen in front of him cannot be ignored. According to Crowder, it is the sheer number of up-and-coming players that brings some excitement -players like Joe Cohen, Tree Morant and 2004 signee Brandon Daniel, who unexpectedly had pushed 300 pounds entering camp. It is those space eaters that allow Crowder to be himself. "When they finally get the defense and see what they can do with it, it's exciting because if the offense has to account for the linemen, you can run free as a linebacker and hit SEE FOOT, PAGE 28 NiCK Wst / Alligator StaT UF redshirt freshman quarterback Justin Midgett has seen increased time on the practice field as the Gators' backup quarterback, Gavin Dickey, is splitting time between UF baseball and football.

It's everything you dreamed of back in December when UF was anointed the No. 1 team in America and you gave a quick fist-pump. But this is reality and I set out to observe the Gators' next possible phenom. His name is Corey Brewer and he's UF's first McDonald's All-American since Anthony Roberson. Ever since Bonell Colas' career ended against Manhattan, I've been asked questions about the 6-foot-8 Brewer. He's known as a top-notch defender and a tall wingman who could instantly become a starter for Billy Donovan. While I've read about him, seen his statistics, talked to his mother and even spoke to him once, I've never seenbim in action. So I figured Wednesday night's McDonalds's AllAmerican game, showcasing the best high school talent in the nation, would be the perfect opportunity to see a first glimpse of a potential star. Once again, it was disappointment for the Gators faithful. Not that Brewer played poorly, but he barely broke a sweat and UF fans were unable to really see the talAndrew ent that has made him one of the topAbramson 24 high school players in the nation. Drew's Control Unfortunately this was the year aabramson@alligator.org of the pro-child, where nearly every starter in the high-school game is considering trading in his gym sneakers for an Armani suit. Brewer came into the game with little fanfare while Dwight Howard and Sebastian Telfair, younger than you in age but soon to be wealthier than you could imagine, shared the spotlight. As soon as the commentators said Telfair was hyped since elementary school, I knew the apocalypse was coming. It's been rumored that as many as seven of the first 15 picks could be from high school, forcing players like David Lee and Roberson down on the NBA wish list. So Brewer was a mere afterthought and had no shot at playing anything other than garbage time in this dull matchup labeled NBAAll-Star Game 2010. Brewer finally made it to the free-throw line in the second half, making 1 of 2 free throws. He at least looked like he'll fit in with his teammates, with his tall but lanky frame. He didn't attempt to take over the game and looked content to be a role player. It's not fair to judge a player after a brief showing in an all-star game, and Brewer could immediately be the best defender on a team as defensively challenged as the Gators. But he's not the physical big man the Gators need. The problem is that those big men were in the game, but using it as an opportunity to boost their NBA resume. Interestingly, these kids weren't even in high school the last time the Gators made a run in the Tournament. And as the game was coming to a close, I couldn't help but think that even after his national television debut, I still haven't really seen Brewer play. I saw enough, however, that I won't be counting on him to be UF's savior. ALLIGATOR www.alligator.org/sports & I I

THURSDAY, APEEII[AW ALLIGATOR, 27 BASEBALL Record crowd witnesses rebound win against FSU Nick West/ Alligator Staff UF pitcher Connor Falkenbach relieved starter Steven Porter with 5. innings of shutout baseball, which allowed the Gators to overcome an early 4-0 deficit. By LOUIS ANASTASIS Alligator Writer Ianastasis@alligator.org The Gators went from heaven to hell to heaven again -all in the same game. Behind the encouraging voice of a McKethan Stadium record crowd, the UF baseball team (25-5, 5-1 Southeastern ConferenCe) rebounded twice to defeat the Semifoles 7-6 Wedn'esday eveng. Down one run in the b0ttomobf the 11th inning, the Gators tied the Seminoles (21-8) on an Adam Davis run and then won the game when Florida State shortstop Bryan Zech couldn't handle a routine grounder, allowing right fielder Ben Harrison to score the winning run. "I kind of peaked my head to take a look, and I saw the ball booted to the outfield, so I stomped on the plate pretty hard," Harrison said. Harrison was close to sitting the game out because of a stomach virus, but played after visiting UF's infirmary. Though Harrison said he lost significant weight over the past few days, UF coach Pat McMahon says he and other players have gained invaluable experience through the game. "A .!l:,of young men on both teams grew up today," McMahon said.

By BRYAN APP Alligator Contributing Writer Critics of its offense had better speak softly, because the UF softball team is listening and liable to prove them wrong.

UF experienced an offensive explosion on Wednesday, putting up 11 hits to score its 11 runs in only six innings, as the game was called due to the eight-run mercy rule. Freshman Melissa Zick continued her consistent batting performance going 2 for 2, but more importantly, she received assistance from a previously slumping UF lineup. Kristen Butler contributed with a 2-for-4, three-RBI performance, as did Lacy Howard who went 2 for 3 with ahome run. "It just takes one hit, and then we're on. fire," Howard said. "It was really exciting to see the whole team do great today." Things seemed to be fallButler ing apart early for the Gators as a throwing error and a wild pitch with a runner on put the Tigers up 2-0 in the first. "If they're going to beat us, go through." The Gators had all but won the game entering the ninth inning, but with two outs and a wer on third base, UF closer Darrerribt~ay allowed FSU outfielder Matt Sauls to score the tying run. The RBI came courtesy of UF first baseman C.J. Smith's good friend, Shane Robinson. The flawed inning failed to demoralize the Gators. ,.!t"A lot ofiNUng men on both .-teams up today.To be champions, these"are things you have to go through." Pat McMahon UF baseball coach "I never thought we'd lose," Harrison said. "I knew we'd have to come in and rally." The Gators appeared to put their offense together throughout the game but didn't convert until the sixth inning when the team scored five runs, topping FSU's four-at the time.

FSU's Rhett James held the Gators two hits and no runs in his first five nings pitched before breaking down the sixth. James finished with a perrnal-best eight strikeouts. UF's victory was due in large part the right arm of pitcher Conner ilkenbach. Falkenbach pitched 5 1/3 nings of no-walk, no-run baseball in lief of Porter.

28, ALLIGATOR U THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 2004 TRACK AND FIELD UF heads west for Texas Relays By MATHEW RUIZ Alligator Contributing Writer When the UF men's track and field team travels to Austin for the Texas Relays this weekend, the team won't be counting victories before it races. "One thing I've learned about track is, anybody can beat anybody on any given day," UF hurdler Josh Walker said, wl 6 currently has the fastest 110-meter hurdle time in the nation. "I don't go into any race thinking, 'I'm gonna win this,' because you never know. Your bad day could be someone else's great day." But if anyone has earned the right to be overconfident, it could be Walker and the Gators, who head into the Texas Relays coming off of a stellar performance in front of their home crowd at the Florida Relays last weekend. The Gators had numerous first-place finishes, both in the meet and nationally. Whi veterans like Walker and Moise Joseph held their own Walker with a win in the 110 hurdles and Joseph anchoring the 4x800 relay -lit was a foursome of young Gators that might have.stolen the show. Featuring three freshmen and a sophomore, UF's "rookie" team ran the fastest time in the nation (3:03.18), one and a half seconds quicker than the second-place LSU relay team, which holds second. And. although it trailed by two seconds in the race, the veteran UF relay team still managed to post a time of 3:05.59; the thirdfastest time in the country this year. One member of that veteran relay team, senior Scott sprinter Rickey Harris, is anything but surprised at the insurgence of young talent. Harris, who holds the fastest 400dash time in the nation at 45.69 seconds, has no problem admitting how capable his young teammates are. "The freshman class is the most talented class in the nation, and we told them that," Harris said. Of immediate concern, however, are the Texas Relays, where the Gators will look to qualify more athletes both young and old for the NCAA Regional Championships. SEC ATHLETES OF THE WEEK: Two -Gators have been named Athlete of the Week this week by the Southeastern Conference. Freshman Kerron Clement was named the male track Athlete of the Week for two of the best performances the country has seen in 2004. Clement was recognized for his efforts in the 400 hurdles, which he won with a time of 49.69 (No. 1 in NCAA) and the 4x400 relay, which he anchored to a victory and yet another top time in the nation. Junior Candice Scott was named the female field Athlete of the Week for her performance in both the shot put and the weight throw. Scott won the shot put with a meetrecord throw of 55 feet, 1 1/2 inches and was the top collegiate finisher in both the collegiate and invitational weight throw at the Florida Relays.

Of course, the defensive leader didn't forget the staples at defensive tackle that have game experience. "Ray [McDonald] and Marcus Thomas should be All-SEC," Crowder said. The probability of getting run down during the routine of spring may seem possible given all the defense's big hits on offensive skill players. Because of this, the Gators have strength and conditioning coach Rob Glass to sustain players through the regular schedule of practices. As the units on each side of the ball try to out-do each other, Crowder says they are all the more Crowded likely to get worn down. "I think it gets worse because we're beating the hell out of the offense," he said. "The offense has tried to scheme up stuff. If you have to do to halfback passes and reverses, you're in trouble, but the coaches keep it competitive. "We've got to pick it up because they're going to pick it up." 0
