WE Israel plagued with mor sUicii e bombings *CONTINUED VIOLENCE ON STUDENTS' MINDS DURING PASSOVER. Staff and Wire Report RAMALLAH, West Bank -Saying Israel is in a war for survival, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to smash Palestinian militants in an uncompromising offensive as he addressed a nation rattled by five suicide bombings in five days, including back-to-back attacks Sunday that killed 15 Israelis.

Electricity was cut off and exchanges of fire could be heard. Armored vehicles also massed near biblical Bethlehem. In Ramallah, under Israeli control since Friday, dozens of European .peace activists, their arms raised and holding white flags, marched past Israeli soldiers surrounding Yasser Arafat's office to join the Palestinian leader, saying they would stay with him as human shields. Earlier in the day, Israeli forces surrounding the building exchanged fire with Arafat's guards, andPalestinian officials said art was just a few yards from the fighting. At least 20 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers had been killed in Ramallah since Friday. Late Sunday, witnesses and Palestinian officials said Israeli soldiers opened fire on and killed five policemen when the Palestinians tried to surrender in Ramallah. "We put our weapons at the main entrance and started to walk out when the Israelis fired on us;" said a policeman at the building who would only give his name as Omar. He said 17 police remained in the building and the standoff continued. In a statement, the Israeli military said "wanted men" were in the building and one of them, wearing an explosives belt, opened fire on them. The soldiers chased him and shot him dead, the statement said.

The Florida Department of Labor said there was no evidence that Pearlman and his Orlando-based company, Trans Continental Entertainment, violated such rules as making minors work past 11:30 p.m., as alleged by the mother of two of his former entertainers. Kenneth W. Williams, an administrator in the Labor Department's Office of Compliance and Enforcement, wrote to Pearlman on Thursday and said the allegations are unproven. "Therefore, we are terminating our investigation and closing our files on this case," Williams said. "I'm happy to say that we are vindicated, as expected, from all allegations," Pearlman said.

"It's Poll: public education top priority for Florida vote The Ass d" Press Florida voters consider public education their top priority and would pay higher taxes to increase teacher salaries and reduce classroom overcrowding, according to a poll released Sunday.  The poll, conducted for The Miami Herald and -St. Petersburg Times, shows 58 percent of voters favor raising taxes to improve public education and 37 percent are in opposition. The finding places voters at odds with Gov. Jeb Bush, who is running for re-election in November, and the Republican-controlled Legislature, which prevented attempts to raise taxes to provide more money for schools during the legislative session. The two leading Democratic candidates for governor, Janet Reno and Bill McBride, also have resisted calling for higher taxes to help schools. "I think every politician in the state of Florida that's not clearly on the side of measures to improve public education could pay a price at the ballot box," pollster Rob Schroth said. "Voters are very clear about what they want, and you ignore them at your own political peril." The poll of Florida voters was conducted March 22-28 by Schroth & Associates, a Washington polling firm. The tele-# phone survey of 800 registered voters has a margin of error rate of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Among nine choices, 43 percent of voters said improving public education and public schools was the most important issue. The next-highest priority, improving the state's health care, was second at 9 percent. The poll provides a mixed review of Bush's record. A majority of voters, 5 1 percent to 40 percent, disapprove of the job the governor is doing to improve public education. But a clear majority -60 percent -says Bush's record on schools alone would not prevent them from voting for him in November. Among both parties, voters were willing to tax themselves more to improve education. Democrats strongly support it, 64-32, and Republicans favor it 53-41. 11 Voters also favor attempts to eliminate school overcrowding by 74 percent to 23 percent. The poll showed that voters' interest in tax cuts has cooled. Only 17 percent favored another tax cut and 41 pe said Florida went too fari ducing taxes and should spent that money on educ and social services instea Camp Cj I I TL' Rard f iretors of Camus Communications, Incpb er of $5 BttoMuS Drafts Everyday OPEN TILL 3 AMI 271"-9 55 5 11302 W.

6, ALIGATOR, MONDAY, APRIL 1, 2002 allgator Femed i 1906 Independent since 1973, We Inform. You Decide. Jenny L. Allen Jason Brown Mark Word EdWd. Iord EDITORIALS Action It would be irresponsible and foolisK to simply say the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians should stop. In act, it almost would be insulting for us to say the fighting should stop. It's foolish to ask two sides of a conflict thathas been bitterly waged for generations to lay down their arms, put decades of fighting behind them and let bygones be bygones. These two factions are engaged in a struggle we simply cannot understand that could go on forever, and it is not fair for us to demand an end to the fighting. But, in the face of escalating violence and shows of military force in both Israel and Palestine, it is clear something must be done to stem the tide of disorder that surrounds the Middle East. And in order for that to happen, the United States must get more involved. Our current administration's abomination of a policy concerning the Middle East must be changed. When our current president took office, he made it perfectly clear he had no interest in getting involved in a peacemaking plan for the Middle East. He canceled the CIA's efforts to broker a peace between Israel and Palestine, hedged on creating a new Middle East peace team, and he generally sat on the sidelines, allowing the chips to fall where they may. It is quite clear -that policy has failed. Our government has a moral obligation to try and bring a sense of peace to the region. Granted, we shouldn't send troops over to join in on the fighting. However, the United States should become involved in trying to broker some kind of peace between Israel and Palestine. Both sides are the good guys, and both sides are the bad guys. They are all fighting a battle where both sides believe they are right, and for us to try and condemn one particular side would be wrong. We're not here to assign blame or to try and claim we know who is correct. But the U.S. must get involved in trying to end the violence the conflict has wrought. President George W. Bush and his administration must take an active role in the peace process in the Middle East. It is time for Bush to get off the bench and into the game. Alzheimer's relief This must be the "compassionate" part of compassionate conservatism ... The Bush administration has made the unprecedented decision to authorize Medicare coverage for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Although nearly four million people suffer from the disease, many people were denied reimbursement for mental health services, hospice care or home health care. The claims, were denied because it was believed people with Alzheimer's would not benefit from medical care. However, new studies show people with Alzheimer's do get something from psychotherapy, physical and occupational therapy and other services. We think this is a very good, if not wholly unexpected development from the Bush administration. Even though we suspect this may be a case of the powerful anticipating the future and ensuring they will be comfortable in their twilight years, the bottom line is those suffering from Alzheimer's disease will no longer be swept under the rug simply because they lack the money for good care. -The ALLIGATOR encourages comments from readers.

GUEST COLUMN From gun control to firing rang, I always have proclaimed myself a pacifist. My friends accuse me of having liberal views -almost to the point of socialism. In about 30 years I never had held a gun in my hand -in factI had chastised those who had -until last week. Last Friday, while I lounged on my couch intentionally avoiding schoolwork and wondering how I'd pass the afternoon,-a friend called to ask if I would go with him to his outdoors club so he could shoot some of his guns. He's heard my rant on guns before. My initial instinct told me to decline, but boredom and curiosity beat out principle, and I agreed to go. Still strong in my convictions, though, I repeated in my head all the facts and statistics about the dangers of firearms I could remember. Almost 40,000 Americans die every year from gunshot wounds. More people are shot and killed in a week in the United States than in a year in Europe. Yet there I was -despite-my beliefs about the evils of guns -on my way to the shooting range. It looked like I'd pictured as we arrived, like a golf driving range with a tin roof sheltering the area from which people shoot. After donning the required safety glasses and earplugs, I watched my friend fire off several rounds through a paper target on a stick 25 yards away. The entertainment value in this activity eluded me, but he was having a great time. Eventually he turned to me and said, "It's your turn." He gave me a quick lesson on the safety switch and how to aim using the metal guides on the muzzle of the gun and told me to "let her rip." And soI did. After I fired my first shot ever, my friend yelled, "Bullseye! You're a natural!" I aimed and fired nine more times, emptying the gun. Nothing I could admit to without M tion compares to the rushlI e rienced asi walked out to see where the bullets had All 10 hit the target, four of them almost dli center. I couldn't believe it. GREGG MACLEERY SPEAKING OUT I shot several more times that aftemoom The eye-hand coordination involved witb aiming and shooting a gun, it surprised me0 discover, is just as challenging as anyot more socially acceptable sport. The adrenalin] buzz given by feeling the power gene simply by squeezing my index finger is wl beyond anything other sports have to offer. When my friend dropped me at my house emphatically thanked him and resumed nY position on the couch to bask in my newfound experience. Then it hit me. The terrible realization that was now a hypocrite, one of the most derogatory labels in the English language. My nieces, nephews and future children wl still hear from me that there is no reason they ever need to fire a gun in their lives. I'lln support gun control or abolition and cast mY votes toward those who share that view. But truthfully, I won't wait until the neil time my friend invites me to the shooting range -I'll probably call and ask him whet he's going again.

By Cameron Ackroyd Alligator Staff Writer icackroyd@alligator.org Two weeks after being elected Student Body vice president, Joel Howell already is smiling about what he is doing for the students. He said he wants to get out to where students spend their time studying and make the experience as comfortable as possible. First on his list is "Down the hill," a popular name for the engeering area situated "down e hill between Center Drive and North-South Drive. The area serves the majority of engineer-. ing students, of which there are more than 5,000. This is where Howell, an engineering student, spends most of his time. However, he complains that few facilities were added to promote the comfort of the students. "At lunchtime you have to pack up your equipment and head up the hill to the Reitz Union, but when you get tothe door it's raining," Howell explains. "You have to go to the vending machines and buy a candy bar and head back up to the lab and resume your work." Howell decided he had to change things., "When I first brought'this up to UF's Business Services Division, I told them we want something like the food place by Little Hall," Howell'-said. "They laughed, patted me on the shoulder and booted me out the door." Howell begged, pleaded and coerced, and last week a Java City food cart was added to the atrium serving drinks, breakfast and lunch items and snacks. There always is a line, but many students and faculty are pleased. "This is the perfect thing to keep me awake during my exciting engineering classes," engineering graduate student Amrit Gill said. Howell said next on the list are tables for the outside area and couches for the atrium. He said he and the student New Engineering Building lab administrator, Billy Perez, also are working to extend the computer lab hours in the New Engineering Building. At midnight Perez always has to throw people out of the lab. One time at midnight Perez was about to leave, and even turned off the lights. But he got the feeling he should check the lab one more time and found a student hiding under a desk in a back corner. "People used to try and do it all the time, but I lock the computers up so no one can log on," Perez said, By Kylene M. Kultau Contributing Writer Some local residents believe the herbal supplement kava is not harmful if taken correctly, despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration. "To me it's no different than drinking a beer in the afternoon," said Seigfred Fagerberg, UF health science education professor. The FDA began investigations of kava and warned consumers and medical professionals of potential liver damage risks associated with the herbal supplement. The FDA received a report of liver damage in connection with kava in the United States, but other countries have seenmore than 25 reports of patients with liver-related problems associated with kava products. Kava, a member of the black' pepper family, has gained popularity for relieving anxiety, stress and insomnia, and has been used for ceremonial purposes in the .South Pacific. Switzerland, France, Canada, C gey and the United Kingconsumers of the liver-related risks associated with the use of kava, according to the FDA. "It's an overreaction to a limited use of data," Fagerberg said. The limited studies of herbal supplements present problems because medical professionals read one study and turn it into a norm, while the FDA blows a small batch of 'negative cases out of proportion, he said. "There are 10 million alcoholics in the world and that doesn't make the front page," he said. Beth Auten, an employee of Mother Earth Market West and UF anthropology and botany graduate student, said she did not see anything wrong with kava. The calming effect of kava lasts a couple of hours, though it smelled and tasted like dirt, she said. If people are prone to certain health problems, they should be aware of the herbal supplements and medications they take, she said. "It pays to be careful," Auten said. "If kava was detrimental to peoples' health, people wouldn't have used it for thousands of years." t1" Graduating?

Though the first three innings were close to lifeless offensively, the fourth inning showed promise when Prieto had a leadoff double.

When he slid into position two years ago, he filled the void left byBob Knight one of the most.:explosive and' hot-tempered, yet successful, humans to coach the game. Bloomington didn't want Davis. Not because of who he was. Instead, because of who he would have to follow. They wanted their Knight. You think Ron Zook has a tough job following a legend? Now imagine if Steve Spurrier had been fired. Welcome to Davis' world. Rough life, right? That's nfot.even close to all of it. Davis is a guy who lost his father when he was 12.

Ramsey (4-1) set a career high in innings pitched and struck. out six, but Auburn (21-8, 5-4 Southeastern Conference) reached base in all but one inning while he was in the game. Auburn left seven runners on base, and UF (24-6, 6-3 SEC) ended threats with a double play and a pickoff. ."The thing with clQsing is that you've got to pretend it's a close game and you have oie-nothing lead,",sai d Ramsey, who' saved nine' gamegrfo t tie Gator$ls vifetlike every44_ also &Pt some hel -from left fielder Aafon eobreraa Sobiradught ribt flde Dou~g Vines wouldbhow* Irun wiith a leaping catch-over tlie out~eld wall. mThat wind cairied it, attit took a frnt rot trzd ~eSwi A4W broken-,tle soreles the fourth innin-.. the Tigers a 1-0 lead.

"Indoors I had a little trouble -off and on, and I was expected to do well. I just hope outdoors I can come out here and make a strong showing." Moss was not the only freshman to turn heads in the high jump over the weekend. The UF men's team got an added boost when freshman James White, on loan from the basketball team,.topped the field in the event. Coach Doug Brown said with a little more practice, White could get even better. "He's having a good time out there," Brown said. "Lord help any of the other high jumpers if he ever figures it out. That's all I can say. "If he figures out how to arch, just arch, that's all I think we'll teach him. I don't think we'll bother with anything else." Last season, the UF men's team swept the relay events. That did not happen over the weekend, but they still managed to make history. The 4x800 men's relay team broke the school record, which had been standing since 1969. Mut Marriott I AlligorStff After finishing the indoor seaUF's Megan Westfall seta school record in the invitational son two weeks earlier, junior pole vault with a mark of 13-4.25 to take second place in the Moise Joseph said he was skeptievent, cal about how well the team would perform. "I was very surprised with how these guys turned out," he said. "We ran some awesome times, especially for this early in the season. "We felt good, and this gives us real good momentum." The women's relay teams did not fare as well with the 4x1500 coming in third, and the 4x800 and 4x200 finishing fourth. UF had a chance to defeat South Carolina in the 4x200, but a faulty handoff proved costly for the Gators. Despite not taking home a win, Jones said the relays were a successful event. A few key runners are recovering from injuries and when they return to full speed, Jones said everything should fall into place. By the meet's end, the Gators set two meet records, a track record and two school records. Candice Scott continued to tear apart the women's team's record book in the hammer-throw. Scott set a school record in the hammer throw with an automatic qualifying mark of 204-2. "We had a good relay meet as far as I'm concerned," he said. "We should have won the 4x200. I'm not going-to take anything away from South Carolina. They Won it. Our kids lost their focus, made a mistaken the handoff and it cost them the win. Other than that, it was good." ol
