ELECTIONS 2008 Campaign for sheriff begins early By JESSICA PONN Alligator Staff Writer jponn@aligator.org Though the next election for the position of Alachua County sheriff is still months away, the candidate challenging current Sheriff Sadie Darnell is starting his campaign sooner rather than later.

Faulkner Press, the software company used to supplement courses, filed the 63-page federal lawsuit on Tuesday against Einstein's Notes, a Gainesville business that sells class notes taken by student employees. "What can I do? I'm in the middle of the ocean. When I get back in the country, I can move on from there." Thomas Bean owner of Einstein's Notes Jim Sullivan, a Gainesville attorney representing Faulkner Press in the city's U.S. district court, said note-takers hired by Einstein's have copied lecture notes from UF professor Michael Moulton without permission since 2007. Moulton teaches Wildlife Issues in a Changing World and Biodiversity Conservation: Global Perspectives, a large lecture class that requires students to buy electronic textbooks printed by Faulkner. The lawsuit also accuses Einstein's Notes of copying practice questions from Moulton's Web site and software published by Faulkner for student handouts. Thomas Bean, owner of Einstein's, said he heard about the lawsuit when reporters called him Tuesday and could not comment on the complaint. Bean said he comes to Gainesville once a month and handles much of his business by phone. He said he's currently on vacation with his family in the British Virgin Islands. He has 20 days to respond to the lawsuit, Sullivan said. "What can I do? I'm in the middle of the ocean," Bean said. "When I get back in the country, I can move on from there."

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2008 U ALLIGATOR, 3 STUDENT GOVERNMENT Address controversy continues By ILEANA MORALES Alligator Writer imorales@asIigator.org UF Student Senate President Kellie Dale said she would not leave her post despite a student senator's request for her immediate resignation on Tuesday night. The request came after Sen. Ben Cavataro, Orange and Blue Party Senate leader, asked for Sen. Sheldon Nagesh's resignation last week because Nagesh's residential address at the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity house isn't in District E, which he has represented since Feb. 19. A hearing to investigate Nagesh's rightful district is scheduled for 3 p.m. today in Room 287 of the Reitz Union. Sen. Leslie Veiga, a member of the Orange and Blue Party, said Dale was "fully aware of the fabrication" of Nagesh's application to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he was appointed to at last week's Senate meeting by a vote of 41-10. "Dale turned a blind eye to the truth," Veiga said., "No government can function without the trust of the people." Dale asked senators to check their facts before making "serious accusations" during public debate. She said she followed all procedures regarding review of applications for Senate seats while she was Senate president pro-tempore last semester, adding that Veiga's allegations would be dispelled at today's hearing. Dale said she was originally confused about Nagesh's address on his application, but it was approved by other senators and the Student Senate secretary. Audrey Goldman, Rules and Ethics Committee chairwoman, asked senators to ignore Veiga's accusations because they were made before Nagesh's hearing, rendering them "unethical." "Dale turned a blind eye to the truth." Leslie Veiga student senator But the meeting wasn't completely confrontational. Senators also unanimously passed a resolution to honor former UF student and Army veteran Jonathon Cote, who was kidnapped in November 2006 while working for a private security firm in Iraq and is still missing. Cote attended UF beginning in fall 2005 for one year and was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity. Matt Sloan, the fraternity's president who read the resolution to senators, said Cote was a leader and mentor within his fraternity and served his country "in a time of peril." Sloan said the resolution lets Cote's family know UF cares. Lawyer added to BOG HE IS ALSO CHAIRMAN OF FAU'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES. Norman Tripp, chairman of Florida Atlantic University's Board of Trustees and a South Florida lawyer, was appointed to Florida's Board of Governors, the State University System's highest governing body, on Tuesday. Gov. Charlie Crist appointed Tripp to fill the vacancy left by Jorge Arrizurieta, who left the board to serve on Florida International University's Board of Trustees. The state Senate must confirm Tripp's appointment. Mark Rosenberg, the board's chancellor, described Tripp as "a voice of moderation," which Rosenberg said would help the board as it fights the Legislature's attempts to change its composition. A joint resolution passed by the Senate would reduce the board's size from 17 to eight members. The resolution must be approved by 60 percent of voters and the House before becoming State law. News Tripp said he doesn't have a comment on the resolution. "I believe in the Board of Governors, and I believe that they have a role that they can play in coordinating the efforts of all of the universities and making the system stronger," he said. Tripp said he wants to make sure each university's board of trustees has authority to run its own area, and he wants to keep tuition affordable. -DEBORAH SWERDLOW WEDNESDAY LADIES NIGHkT Is your wallet frying to tell you something? 500 PLASMA DONORS NEEDED NOW!

4, ALLIGATOR U WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2,2008 UF student wins overseas trip on 'The Price is Right' 0 STUDENT WINS MORE THAN $25,000 IN PRIZES. By DEBORAH SWERDLOW Alligator Writer dswerdlow@alligator.org A UF student won more than $25,000 worth of prizes, including a trip to Singapore, on Tuesday's episode of "The Price is Right." Kristin Lundy, a UF health education and behavior senior, competed on the show March 10. She won an electric fireplace, room sanitizer, telephone, pizza grill, assortment of sleepwear, bedroom set and the Singapore trip. "I'm keeping all of it," Lundy said after watching the show, except for the fireplace, she added. She watched the show at The Swamp Restaurant on Tuesday morning with about 15 friends and teachers. Lundy's name was the first one called at the beginning of the show, and her friends in the restaurant screamed and clapped when they saw her run down the aisle with her arms waving in the air. The first 40 minutes of the show were tense, as Lundy kept missing chances to move off "contestants row" and play a pricing game. From there, a contestant can win more prizes and move on to the Showcase Showdown to bid on a collection of prizes, usually including a car or vacation package. Lundy got her big break when her bid on an electric fireplace was the closest guess without going over the actual retail price. As she ran up to the stage, she slipped and pitched forward. After regaining her balance, she found out that her next potential prize was a new, silver Dodge Caliber. Drew Carey, the show's host, explained Lundy's pricing game, which was called the "Bonus Game." She was presented with four prizes and their suggested prices and had to decide if the Ray Khan / Alligator UF senior Kristin Lundy covers her face as she watches her appearance on "The Price Is Right" with a gathering of her friends at The Swamp Restaurant on Monday morning. actual retail price was higher or lower than the suggested price. One of the prizes had the car as a hidden bonus. Lundy guessed correctly for three out of the four prizes but missed the one linked to the car. "During the commercial break, (Carey) was like, 'You should've had that,"' Lundy said. The suspense continued about five minutes later when she tied with another contestant to move into the Showcase Showdown. When Lundy won the tiebreaker on the show, she jumped up and down so vigorously she lost one of her orange hoop earrings. "Everyone notices my earring's gone," she said as she checked her text messages, which were streaming in nonstop. By the end of the day, she said she'd gotten more than 50 messages. Lundy's friends screamed as they watched her win the showcase, which included the sleepwear, bedroom set and Singapore trip. "So many emotions," said Trina Clark, a UF criminology senior and friend of Lundy's. "You can't really explain how excited yo'u were for her." Lundy said some of the prizes have already arrived at her house, and she'll probably take the Singapore trip as a graduation present to herself. "I've never been out of the country," she said. "Who goes to Singapore? Me!" Unusual number of plots still available in UF garden It's the perfect time of year to plant peppers, tomatoes, zucchini and squash, but Gainesville residents are not taking full advantage of their gardening opportunities, according to Susan Vince, treasurer of the UF Organic Garden Cooperative. The cooperative has eight plot vacancies to fill -an unusual situation at this point in the year. "It's not that people haven't enjoyed the experience," Vince said. "It's just circumstances that they have to leave the plots." Vince said with rising grocery costs, gardeners may find it economical to grow their own fruits and vegetables. "It's amazing how much you can grow just on a 12-by-25-foot plot," she said. Each plot costs $15 for six months.

6, ALLIGATOR N WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2,2008 Editorial Safer Sex Ed Stopping abstinence-only curriculum makes sense earlier last month, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the findings from a groundbreaking study on sexual activity among American teens, and the news was not good. They found at least one in four sexually active teenage American girls has a sexually transmitted disease. And so, in the state that receives the second highest amount of Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage sex-education -funding, clearly the 48,440 teenage pregnancies a year proved that abstinence was just not catching on -at least not as fast as the human papillomavirus. But we're fortunate that at least some lawmakers had the courage to do something different. The state Senate's Education Pre-kindergarten-12th Grade Committee, by a 4-3 vote, approved a bill that would require schools to teach students more about sex than not having it. Their victory this Tuesday renewed our hope that Florida's not-so-glamorous title of being secofid in the nation for HIV/ AIDS rates and sixth in teen pregnancy rates may be a thing of the past. So state Sens. Nan Rich and Ted Deutch, as those not that far removed from the high school realities of inadequate sex education, we commend your actions and applaud your efforts to pass the Healthy Teens Act that you introduced in January. The act will finally require Florida's public schools that already teach information about sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy and family planning to provide medically accurate and comprehensive sex education -including facts about abstinence and methods of preventing. the spread of diseases and unintended pregnancy., It's been a long time coming. And if we didn't already need a wake-up call, the teen birth rate actually increased between 2005 and 2006 -for the first imne in fifteen years. We're thinking the nationwide policy of promoting abstinence-only programs to the tune of a $1.5 billion failure, was not money well spent. By holding up a photo of Jamie Lynn Spears on a magazine cover (nice touch, Deutch), we're hoping you drove the message home that this problem will not just go away if we continue to pretend that teens aren't having sex. They have been for years, they still are and they will continue to do so. The great disservice of not inning them with the information they need to make healthy choices is the only real catastrophe in this situation. With the knowledge that this was not a sweeping victory for a common sense approach to sex ed, we can only hope that elected officials will listen to what Florida voters want and truly ignore extremist threats. However, the more militant abstinent proponents would have you believe otherwise. Though some have tried to get their way by employing obnoxious methods -one pastor in St. Lucie County threatened to post fliers with School Board members' faces -next to descriptions of sex acts when they 'were considering whether to adopt a more comprehensive sex-ed program called Get Real About AIDS -we're hoping they'll start to come around. An overwhelming majority of Floridians, including a surprisingly large amount who described themselves as evangehcal Christians, think public schools should teach sex education, according to a St. Petersburg Times survey. The fact is that the Florida Healthy Teens Act is promoting something that actually works and in the process succeeds in putting the most important resource for Florida's future first -the next generation. il t -in epadet flord altgatoR Chad Smith EDITOR Devin Culclasure MANAGING EDITOR Panagiota Papakos OPINIONS EDITOR Don Kershaw Leigh Shapiro EDITORIAL BOARD The Alligator encourages comrnents from readers.

The puritanical purveyors of free-market capitalism have made a pastime out of demonizing anyone who questions the infallibility of "the invisible hand." Those who bow at the altar of Kudlow, Cavuto and Cramer have successfully -and erroneously -combined any sort of government regulation with socialism, transforming an innocuous and monotonous term into a dubious insult. Government regulation in the name of fairness and transparency has been discarded for a let-the-marketdecide ethos of sink or swim. The result of this strict adherence to the reanimation of Social Darwinism -what commentator Cornel West has called "free-market fundamentalism" -has been a windfall for a few and a wipeout for many. In case you've missed it, here's a brief and generalized primer: a subprime mortgage is a type of loan or mortgage that financial institutions issue to individuals with poor credit who, as a consequence, are deemed to present a greater risk (i.e. for paying back the loan). Because the lender is assuming greater risk in issuing such a loan, subprime mortgages come with higher interest rates. The high interest rates combined with other factors, such as rising gas prices, job losses, health care and other climbing costs, have lead to record foreclosures, the economic effects of which are not limited to those losing their homes. Communities feel the sting of foreclosures as property values tumble and state and local governments lose tax revenue as a result. The combination of speculative purchasing, predatory lending and the absence of government oversight has created a perfect storm of economic instability that has Wall Street and Main Street equally fearful of a market Joshua Fredrickson letters@alligator.org meltdown. In the midst of this economic upheaval, what is the government doing? Or perhaps the better question is what should the government be doing? Last week, the Federal Reserve acted swiftly to save a soon-to-be casualty of the subprime incinerator. No, it wasn't a family of four from Fort Myers about to lose their home. It was one of Wall Street's largest and most prominent investment banks, Bear Stearns. Conditioned on a $30 billion loan from the Fed (yes, that's our tax dollars at work), JP Morgan purchased Bear Stearns at $2 per share. A year ago, that stock peaked around $170 per share. This government-subsidized Bear Stearns bailout represents what practitioners of the dismal science call "moral hazard"that is, rewarding bad investment decisions with a get-out-of-bankruptcy-free card. The case against such action is it encourages risky investment activities with the knowledge that the cost of failure is simply a government bailout. The rationale for the Fed's bold move rests on the assumption that were Bear Stearns to fall, -the repercussions for an alreadyfloundering economy might be too great to bear (forgive the pun). But what about the more than 200,000 individuals and families whose homes were foreclosed last month alone? Yes, some made bad decisions and purchased a home they couldn't afford, but countless others were the victims of unfair lending practices. Regardless of which camp these unfortunate souls fall into, if the government can float a $30 billion loan to a former Wall Street titan, why is there no help forthcoming for Joe and Jane Six-Pack? Oh, that's right, we must let the market decide their fate. Joshua Fredrickson is a political science senior. His column appears on Wednesdays.

'Juno' writer to speak at UF E DIABLO CODY PAID $40,000 FOR VISIT. Diablo Cody, writer of "Juno" and former stripper, will speak at UF on Tuesday night. The free show will take place at the Phillips Center at 8 p.m. with first-come-first-serve seating, according to a news release from Accent, the Student Government speaker's bureau, which is sponsoring the event. Cody was paid $40,000 for her appearance, said Steven Blank, Accent chairman. "We're totally stoked for it," Blank see said. Cody Cody recently won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for "Juno." She also wrote a memoir in 2006 called "Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper." "Obviously, she has an awesome story," Blank said with a laugh. Blank said Cody's UF show would be modeled after Bravo's "Inside the Actors Studio" with Mike Foley, a journalism professor, peppering Cody with questions. -KIM WILMATH ON CAMPUS Bicycle board holds forum on safety By ZAHARA ZAHAV Alligator Contributing writer Gainesville residents and local police officers discussed the need to educate motorists about the rights of bicyclists and pedestrians on the road at a public forum Tuesday night. Residents told members of the University Police Department and the Alachua County Sheriff's Office that police should give pulled-over motorists a copy of bicycle rules so they will understand that bicycles are equal vehicles. "We get told all the time we're motorists and to follow the same rules," said Julian Castro, a member of The Kickstand, a local volunteer bicycle shop. "But motorists don't treat us like we're also motorists," Castro added. The Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Board held the yearly meeting at Gainesville Regional Utilities, 301 SE Fourth Ave., as a way for citizens. to suggest changes to local transportation laws. About 20 people showed up. Julia Reiskind, chairwoman of the advisory board, said she thought speed bumps should be laid near the roundabouts on Second Avenue. Members of the audience referred to the roundabouts as "deathtraps." Castro and Reiskind mentioned the above-average number of bicyclist fatalities in Florida and the need for drivers to know they share the road. Another main concern of some people at the meeting was whether bicyclists should be required to make a complete stop at stop signs. "We get told all the time we're motorists and to follow the same rules. But motorists don't treat us like we're also motorists." Julian Castro Kickstand member James Mabry, an officer who has been with the UPD bicycle unit since July, said about 25,000 bicycles are on campus every day, so stop signs are necessary for traffic flow. The status of stops signs was discussed for about 25 minutes. Skeet Surrency, a member of The Kickstand, said other states allow bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs to increase their own safety. "As a cyclist, nobody's looking out for you," Surrency said. "If you don't look out for yourself, you're gonna die," he added. WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2008 U ALLIGATOR, 9 | Case similar to 1996 lawsuit involving UF EINSTEINfrom page 1 Sullivan said he issued a cease-and-desist letter to Bean in February, asking that printed materials used to prepare students for tests be removed. Sullivan said Bean politely told him that Einstein's operations are legal. But Sullivan said it's a misconception -one he has waited 12 years to clarify. In 1996, UF filed a lawsuit against a similar company called A-Plus Notes, claiming the company infringed on professors' copyrights by publishing lecture notes. UF lost the suit because the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that students' notes are not professors' intellectual property. "Of course, we have studied that case very carefully, and we stand on their shoulders," LocaR Sullivan said. "We've been very careful News to wait this long and wait for the right time and the right facts." Bean said he insists that his services are legal as deemed by the court in 1996. "The federal courts already ruled upon it," he said. "Like I said, we've been doing this for 16 years." Sheriff Darnell responds to challenger's charges SHERIFF, from page 1 Darnell has inappropriately dismissed sheriff's office employees, shown a lack of respect for her constituents and exhibited poor judgment. Darnell, in response, said she was not going to "go negative." "I run my administration based upon what is best for the citizens of this county," she said. However, Darnell did defend against some of the specific issues Scott raised. In the interview, Scott said Darnell does not prioritize youth problems enough. He said gangs are a growing problem in the county, and that Darnell's administration is not adequately focused on them. "The sheriff is in a closet on this issue," he said. Darnell responded by saying she has a full-time employee dedicated to reducing gangs, and that she believes in reducing crime by reaching out to children and families. Scott also said the sheriff's office should agree to dispatch City of Hawthorne Police Department officers through its communication center. As it stands, if Hawthorne residents call 911 an ASO deputy responds. I don't have any personal axes to grind with the sheriff. This is about the citizens and what's best for -the citizens." Lonnie Scott Gainesville Police captain Darnell said that's because the Hawthorne Police Department has not yet complied with state protocols in creating a plan to dispatch through the sheriff's office. Since he threw his hat into the race, Scott said citizens have told him they feel disrespected by the current sheriff's office administration and that Darnell has been unable to admit when she had made mistakes. "I don't have any personal axes to grind with the sheriff," he said. "This is about the citizens and what's best for the citizens." Scott said if he were elected he would put more deputies on the streets, focus on youth problems and try to increase citizen involvement and input. Darnell said she plans to use momentum from her accomplishments thus far to continue to improve the administration and increase community oriented policing. "I am very comfortable with my decision making after over 30 years in law enforcement," she said. Scott plans to continue his series of presentations in the county's outlying cities first and get to Gainesville in the near future. Darnell said for now her campaign plans involve accepting invitations to speak at events and continuing to be accessible in her office. Do You Want Fries With That? The sculpture "Alachua" by John Henry, known to students as the "French Fries," got an April Fools' Day redecoration to make it look more like its nickname Monday.

Sports WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2,2008 ALLIGATOR www.alligatorSpoxts.org No. 6 Seminoles rout No. 19 Gators in Jacksonville Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff UF pitcher Stephen Locke hurls a pitch during the Gators' 10-2 loss to Florida State at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville on Tuesday night. By KARL HYPPOLITE Alligator Writer khyppolite@alligator.org JACKSONVILLE -Saying the Gators are happy they won't have to return to Jacksonville this season may be an understatement. No. 19 UF dropped a game in Jacksonville for the second consecutive week, this time getting blasted 10-2 by sixth-ranked Florida State at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville on Tuesday night. Through much of the season, coach Kevin O'Sullivan has said the fortunes of the UF baseball team would be dependent on the productivity of its pitching and defense. FSU exploited those areas throughout the evening. The Seminoles used five bunts -three sacrifices and two singles -and a pair of home runs to score five of their 10 runs. "They did a good job of pulling off their bunt game," UF starting pitcher Stephen Locke said. "I kept them off balance last time we played them, and it was smart on their behalf to. do that to get something going for them." Said O'Sullivan: "They 1 a, down some good bunts, and I think we got a dose of our own medicine, to be honest with you." The Gators (20-7, 7-2 Southeastern Conference) and Seminoles (24-3, 11-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) complete their three-game series April 15 in Tallahassee. Tony Delmonico, scored on a Jack Posey sacrifice bunt to give the Seminoles an early Baseball 1-0 lead in the bottom of the second, and FSU tacked on its second run on a Dennis Guinn bunt in the bottom of the third. Locke (2-1), who threw six innings and allowed three runs on eight hits, blamed himself for the loss. "I struggled to find my stuff tonight," he said. "I did the best I could to keep us in the game, but it wasn't good enough." UF attempted a rally in the top, of the fifth with the Seminoles clinging SEE BASE, PAGE 1.9 UF FOOTBALL Tebow wins top amateur award By NICK ZACCARDI Alligator Staff Writer nzaccardi@alligator.org Tim Tebow is getting very familiar with New York. Tebow added the James E. Sullivan Memorial Award to his trophy case Tuesday night in a ceremony at the New York Athletic Club, a five-minute cab ride from where the UF basketball team simultaneously played at Madison Square Garden. The Sullivan Award is given to the nation's most outstanding amateur, meaning Tebow beat out four Olympic sports athletes that his average post-practice autograph seeker has never heard of. Given all of his award ceremonies, speaking engagements and team responsibilities, it's hard to call the last three months an offseason. The family, youth and community sciences major flew to Fort Worth, Texas, for the Davey O'Brien Award, Atlantic City, N.J., for the Maxwell Award and finally New York for the Sullivan among other destinations. Tebow could hardly remember all his travels, but he is happy that jetlag marks the worst of his physical problems after enduring a bruising sophomore season. "I really had an opportunity to let my body rest and recuperate," Tebow said. "I feel as healthy as I've been since I've been in college, which feels really good." Now it's back to work. Tebow enters his third spring session at UF -remember he enrolled early in January 2006 -with a little something to prove. "I don't want to re-open wounds, but taking a team down to win the game," UF coach Urban Meyer Tebow said when asked what Tebow needs to work on. "It's not Tim, it's the whole offense. Can he improve as a quarterback? I believe yes, he can." Tebow carried the Gators when the going got tough late in close games last season but failed to win in the fourth quarter against Auburn, LSU and Georgia. Coach and quarterback *hope the institution of more no-huddle in spring drills will fine-tune the offense. "It's just like high school," said Tebow, SEE FOOT, PAGE 19 Columnist lets fingers fly he Gators played in the semidon't want you finals of the NIT last night, and in Chicago, but when I submitted this article, I where else is a as still trying to decide whether 4 Cuban more o find time in my busy schedule e welcome than uesday evening to watch the game.

18, ALLIGATOR E WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2,2008 Speights plays well in possible last game it erial Syndicated Conen AYlible from QommeciI News Roviders" HOOPS, from page 1 Say what you will about the past, but on this night, the blame falls far from Speights' broad shoulders. The Gators wasted a tour-deforce performance by the big man, who scored 16 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in the loss. After the game, Speights spoke about his future. "I would like to come back," he said. "I have to talk to coach and to my family. We'll see what happens.", The Gators wore white in the game but hardly played the role of host. Crimson-clad fans dominated the makeup of Madison Square Garden's famed stands. There were only a few pockets of Gators faithful, most of whom cheered for Dan Werner. Six people, including Werner's brother Ron, sat behind one of the baskets with their chests painted to spell out his name. Werner, who scored a solid 11 points with 10 rebounds, insisted afterward that fatigue shouldn't have been an issue in a game of this stature. "If you weren't tired, you weren't trying," Werner said. Both teams did their part to build layers on the Garden's backboards. The Gators shot just 16.7 percent from 3-point range. The Minutemen weren't .much better, stroking a woeful 20.8 percent from deep. Men's "I don't think Basketball either team played well offensively," Donovan said. "We just missed so many free throws that we gave them more opportunities." Outside of the stats, and beyond the numbers, where this team will head from here becomes the true focus of this game. In recent weeks, the squad did its part to toss aside the scars it carved through the embattled season, in which UF started strong and faded when it mattered most. Before tonight, it seemed the Gators were headed in the right, direction. Will this be a step back, or just another reason to step forward? "They're really respectable kids, and they always listen," Donovan said. "But I'm just unsure if they really believe in their heart how they should take this and move into next season." Guard Jai Lucas tried to answer his coach's question, a theme the Gators have fought throughout the year. "I don't think we'll take a step back," Lucas said. "We just hit a wall." How the team responds from crashing in a game it had in its pocket is something only the future can decide. For the first time this year, however, UF's youth is a sure positive. With the games gone and the season on the backburner, the group can focus on growing together and improving -something it has plenty of time to achieve. "You can't discount what we've done in the past two weeks," freshman Chandler Parsons said. "We have something to build on for next year, something we think is worth building on." --U ~N >Y99-iftl E l ~ mu lEE uumi-.m iniliohOos .~L~IJL~1 LOGICAL Reccommendations: Eat high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grain products.

"He's having trouble right now commanding his fastball," O'Sullivan said of Mullaney. "When -you don't have that, then commanding your secondary stuff gets tough as well. We'll just go back to the drawing board and work through it some more and run him back out there." ADAMS RETURNS: Freshman Josh Adams returned to the lineup Tuesday with his left ankle wrapped after fouling a ball into it Sunday. Adams went 0 for 3 with a walk. BRYAN, from page 17 about the Alligator staff .James Montgomery, who was the projected starter at tailback for CA, wants to transfer to UF, but the Gators haven't offered him a scholarship yet. This news comes after Urban Meyer said that USC transfer Emmanuel Moody has failed to impress so far in the spring and is fourth on the depth chart at tailback. That puts him behind Kestahn Moore (who has yet to put together a memorable season after three yea, of solid playing time), Chris Rainey (who Meyer said last year was too small to ever be the primary tailback at UF) and Brandon James (who is 5 foot 6 and 180 pounds in high heels and a fat suit) .My colleague Mike McCall recently participated in the University of Florida Fastest Student Contest, posting a piss-poor time of 5.53 seconds in the 40-yard dash. I would have run it, too, but I am not sure I have the stamina for it. Anyway, the winner was supposed to race some UP players, including Percy Harvin. Apparently, UP has reneged on Meyer's plan to offer a scholarship to any student who outruns the group of players. But with Harvin out for the rest of the spring and considering surgery for a heel injury, I say let him race anyway and give a scholarship to students who can't outrun him. They probably need it more .I stumbled upon some UF-related gossip recently: While interviewing Cornelius Ingram after football practice recently, a woman and a little boy approached the UF receiver for a quick chat. "Can you just tell him (the kid) that you played basketball with Matty?" the woman asked. Ingram looked at her like she was nuts. "You know, Matty. Matty Walsh," she said. The woman, who identified herself as the sister of Lauren Anderson, Playboy centerfold model and Walsh's former girlfriend, told Ingram that Walsh and Anderson are back together and living in Belgium, where Walsh is playing basketball professionally. In other news, Walsh went from leaving school early for the NBA draft to now being the second most famous Matt Walsh in sports behind that New England Patriots video guy. Quarterback's knowledge of the game improves entire team FOOT, from page 17 who rewrote the prep record book heading a spread, no-huddle attack at Ponte Vedra Nease High. "You get a much faster pace, get a lot more work in practice, too. So you've got to be ready for all the reps. That's something that we still have to work out, everybody getting used to the no-huddle." Tebow's first spring was spent learning Meyer's system and serving as a student to Chris Leak. He grew up in his second spring and took over for Leak as the leader of the offense. Now, in his third year, he is doing more than improving just his game. Backup quarterback Cameron Newton called Tebow a playercoach and says he can call Tebow at any time with any question. That's a pretty amazing progression for a college student who "Now, it's even more of being that leader and somewhat a coach on the field and trying to handle a lot of things, not just how you play." Tim Tebow UF sophomore quarterback can't order anything stronger than a Shirley Temple. "Each (spring) is unique and has its own challenges," Tebow said. "The first one, you're just getting used to everything, trying to adapt to college ball. The second one, you're trying to get used to being the guy and leading the team. "Now, it's even more of being that leader and somewhat a coach on the field and trying to handle a lot of things, not just how you play." -44 Andrew Stanfili / Alligator Staff UF quarterback Tim Tebow pauses during a timeout during the Gators' 41-35 loss to Michigan-,at the Capital One Bowl on New Year's Day. Tebow won the Sullivan Award in New York Tuesday night.
