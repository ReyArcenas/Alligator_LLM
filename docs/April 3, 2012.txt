SAMANTHA SHAVELLAlligator WriterTim Mason is already a justice, and now he will be president. Mason, an associate justice of the UF Supreme Court, was elected Sunday as the Florida College Democrats 2012-13 president. The Florida College Democrats held its annual convention last weekend at Florida State University. Four teen chapters were present to vote Mason, a 23-yearold Orlando native and second-year UF law student, president Sunday, said Erin Murphy, vice president of Florida College Democrats and president of UF College Democrats. Mason will lead the 22 state College Democrats chapters in furthering the Democratic Party. Mason was the only UF student running for an executive position, according to the Florida College Democrats website. His opponent was Paige Brice from the University of Central Florida. Ben Cavataro was the last UF student to be state president, in the 2009-10 school year, Mason said. I felt honored, and Im focused on the future, he said. He said his No. 1 goal in the fall semester will be to get President Obama re-elected. Central to that would be getting students registered to vote and then getting them to show up at the polls on Election Day, he said. During the spring semester, he said he will be working on a legislative agenda, which will focus on Floridians access to higher education. Mason has been a member of the College Democrats for four years. Before joining the UF College Democrats in the fall of 2010, Mason was a member at UCF, where he received a bachelors degree in political science in Spring 2010. He also attended Valencia College and received his associates degree a few months after graduating high school in 2007. committee, which revises the organizations constitution, for the UF College Democrats, Murphy said. Murphy, a 21-year-old environmental science senior, said she has known Mason for about three years. She met him at the annual convention in 2010 when it was hosted at UCF. Murphy said Mason will do a great job in his new position and is incredibly dedicated to the organization. Im very happy, Mason said. But at the same time, the gravity of the task is very humbling.

Three sur geons had left the hospital in less than two months, and there were not enough faculty to provide needed care to patients, said Dr. Kevin Behrns, chair of the department of surgery at UF. Miami is the only location in Florida that will perform liver transplants for children. Last month, the department of surgery hired a new chief of transplantation surgery, Dr. Jeffrey Fair, United Network for Organ Sharing to resume liver transplants. Shands can currently evaluate patients for liver transplants but cannot put them on an organ donor waiting list. About 30 patients are interested in going back on the Shands waiting list, Behrns said, but it is uncertain how long the hospital will have to wait to perform a liver transplant. The median wait time for a patient on the Shands transplant list is three months, according to the Recipients.

UF psychology researchers John Chambers and Barry Schlenker studied more than 400 UF students over three years. Their research revealed conservative participants tended to exhibit greater optimism, self-esteem and feelings of control over their lives. The research provides a new explanation for what political psychologists call the happiness gap. In a 2006 Pew Research Center poll, 61 percent of Republicans said they were very happy as opposed to only 47 percent of Democrats. This created a mystery for researchers. Factors such as income, religion and age accounted for part of the gap, but they wondered if there was a deeper psychological explanation. In 2007, two social psychologists from New York Univer sity took a crack at the puzzle. Analyzing the happiness gap in the United States and nine other countries, professors Jaime Napier and John Jost concluded conservatives were happier because of their ability to rationalize inequalities. For example, right-wingers may perceive the difference between rich and poor in the U.S. as natural or inevitable, wheretroublesome. Public relations senior Hannah Brown, 28, describes herself as politically neutral. She said shes seen these differences play out in debates on Turlington Plaza and in class. I think conservatives focus more on control and responsibility, she said, and liberals think more about systems. Yet Chambers and his UF colleagues thought this wasnt enough to explain a persistent difference in well-being. By ar guing that conservatives have positive personality traits, they triggered a barrage of criticism. esting and useful, Jost said, but I think the paper goes too far. It ends up telling an incomplete, Pollyanna-ish story. Chambers, however, defended his political neutrality.

Nanny NitwitsBloomberg bans donations to homelessA new proposal by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has many people scratching their heads, and rightly so. Bloomberg might as well be King of the Nannies, given his record on trying to ban, tax and regulate everything he can get his hands on in New York City. In 2010, according to The New York Times, Bloomberg proposed a tax on soda he argued would reduce consumption driving down obesity rates and the accompanying medical costs. The following year, Bloomberg said governments highest duty was to halt the worldwide epidemic of noncommunicable diseases. In other words, the mayor believes government must encourage all of us, through taxes, bans and regulations, to have better dietary habits. In January of this year, the nosy mayor pushed to make it harder to obtain alcohol in New York City by decreasing the number of places that sell adult beverages. Bloombergs philosophy of public health assumes it is the governments role to make us healthier, whether we want to or not. However, his latest decision will likely have even the most nanny-state-oriented people wondering where to draw the line. According to CBS New York, Bloomberg decided to ban food donations to homeless shelters because the city cant asThats right, because there are people out there whose main goal is to take the time, energy and effort to make extremely watch the homeless slowly die of heart disease and high cholesterol. It might be one thing to want to screen the food donated to homeless shelters to ensure that everything had been properly cooked, but to ban food donations is just downright insane. Not only will this proposal cost the city hundreds, if not thousands, in unnecessary food costs, but it will also likely lead to food shortages at homeless shelters across the city. Bloombergs duty to ensure that even the homeless receive properly regulated and healthy food could mean less food to go around and more hungry homeless people. So how, Mr. Bloomberg, are we supposed to regulate the fat, the city? Because, under your ban, more homeless will likely have to dig their way to a few scraps of garbage instead of getting safe, home-cooked meals donated by the most generous in the city. Bloombergs move also completely ignores a new study from the American Journal of Hypertension which found litones life. Do you know what does shorten ones life, Mr. Bloomberg?

Take the Jersey Shore cast, for example. We put this group in a room with a bunch of cameras.

Then they wouldnt have the Games. What if people just stopped watching reality TV? Its a guilty pleasure for many, but has it really become Americas unhealthy addiction? Reputations get trashed for the world to see, and people change for the worse in front of the camera. The only ones who win are the fat-cat producers laughing their way to the bank. Snooki and the Situation may not be shooting arrows and physically stabbing each other, but theres enough verbal backstabbing going around to do some damage. We need to remember that though these people voluntarily agree to be in these shows (unlike The Hunger Games), theyre still people. And yet we smile at their demise. Im not calling for viewers to quit these shows coldturkey, but when the drama becomes so overblown to the point that it gets unbelievably fake, then its time to change the channel. If raunchy shows are your thing, TV has much more to offer than Jersey Shore or Real Housewives in the bazillion channels available (Im talking about South Park, Tosh.0, Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia).

Myers, co-founder of the Repurpose Project, put the used items on display as part of the upcycling movement. Upcycling, which is the process of taking materials and reusing them, has recently gained popularity among some artists and eco-friendly residents. To encourage the movement in Gainesville, Myers opened the doors to his Walk Gainesville. At the Repurpose Project warehouse, artists transform soda can tabs into earrings and weave cassette tapes into evening purses. Bookshelves were mounted to the wall with VHS tapes as makeshift shelves. Myers says the artists inspirations make the Repurpose Project different from other sustainable initiatives. said. Sarah Butz, who attended the organizations opening, came in to explore the warehouse during Art Walk Gainesville and says the project is different from anything she has seen.

She said the warehouse is an inspirational place.

TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 2012 WWW.ALLIGATORSPORTS.ORG UF playing in Jacksonville todayFloridas top-ranked baseball team plays UNF tonight at 7 in Jacksonville. See story, page 15. Davis, Kentucky rollNational player of the year Anthony Davis made just 1 of 10 from FRESHMAN GUARD HAS UNTIL APRIL 29 TO DECLARE FOR NBA DRAFT. GREG LUCA Alligator Staff Writer Florida guard Brad Beal said Sunday night that he has not decided whether he will enter the NBA draft or return to school for his sophomore season. Beal traveled to St. Louis on Friday to discuss his options with his family. He returned to Gainesville on Sunday night. The NBAs deadline for underclassmen to declare is April 29, and Beal said he plans to take the majority of the month to reach his decision. The NCAAs deadline for an underclassman to declare is April 10. However, if a prospect does not reach a decision by April 10, he still has the opportunity to declare as long as he does so before the NBAs April 29 deadline. Beal scored 14.8 points per game and grabbed a team-high 6.7 rebounds per game during his freshman season, leading scouts and analysts to project him to be selected as high as No. 3 in the upcoming draft, which will be held on June 28. Beals NBA decision has been a topic of conversation for weeks, but he mostly avoided those questions during the season. When that time comes after this season Im going to sit down with coach and my family and AP Photo Florida players (from left) Kenny Boynton, Erving Walker, Brad Beal, Patric Young and Erik Murphy answer questions during a Sweet 16 media session in Phoenix. Beal and Boynton are both still undecided about returning to the Gators next season. Beal returns from visit with family, still mulling decision TOM GREEN Alligator Staff Writer Latroy Pittman is already making a name for himself in Gainesville. After just three months on campus, the freshman wide receiver has impressed coach Will Muschamp during Floridas three weeks of spring practices. Latroy Pittman is a guy who is really coming on and doing a nice job, Muschamp said last week. Hes still swimming a little bit mentally, which is to be expected, but hes physical, he mixes it in well, hes made some Ive been very pleased with his progress to this point. That progress continued into Floridas weather-shortened scrimmage Saturday, when Muschamp said Pittman earned offensive player of the day honors. Muschamp said Pittman hauled in a deep ball from quarterback Jeff Driskel during the scrimmage despite good coverage by sophomore cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy. As one of six early enrollees the Gators brought in at the beginning of the semester, Pittman has earned the most praise from coaches this spring, especially at a position of need for Florida. Last season, the Gators struggled to as the teams wide receivers accounted for 69 of the teams 182 receptions. Only Deonte Thompson recorded Notebook: Pittman making waves; Gillislee cements role Everyone wants to know how Brad Beal will be celebrating his 19th birthday. The NCAA is hastily demanding to hear Beals plans by April 10. The NBA stated it can wait a little longer, until April 29. But Im guessing all of you reading would probably like to learn now. Will Beal be ringing in another year of life in the Prudential Center on June 28 onstage at the NBA Draft or is he going to be enjoying his birthday in the simpler, less Regardless of whether he chooses to return to Florida for his sophomore season or picks the cool, free draft hat and millions of dollars that come with a lottery picks cision. Unfortunately, he only has another 26 days to make it. While the NCAAs early entry deadline this year is an almost criminally unfair eight days after the national championship game, the NBA isnt doing collegiate underclassmen any favors either with its April 29 cutoff date. in recent memory, Beal and other potential draftees will not have the chance to attend any predraft workouts with NBA teams or gauge Just three years ago, college players were able to remove their names off the early entry list a week before the NBA Draft. Now, they have to make a concrete decision almost two months in advance, leaving essentially no time to test the proverbial draft waters. The new deadlines are rigged even more NCAAs future on-court product as well as college coaches, who will get an earlier handle on how their rosters will look next Early entry deadline should Muschamp SEE HOOPS, PAGE 14 SEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 14 SEE BOOTHE, PAGE 14THE BOOTHE REVIEW John Boothetwitter: @jjboothe TweetableI wonder if cheeseburger Charlie is at the game tho lol..

14, ALLIGATOR TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 2012AP PhotoFlorida junior guard Kenny Boynton shoots over Louisvilles Chane Behanan during the Elite Eight. Boynton said Monday he is unsure if he will return for his senior season. Boynton also undecided; Young, Rosario returningwere just going to talk about it, Beal said March 23, the day before UFs Elite Eight game against Louisville. Even after the Gators fell 72-68 to end the season just short of the Final Four, Beal was mum on his future plans. Im still just affected by this loss, Beal said on March 24. Im not thinking about next season yet. Junior Kenny Boynton is still mulling over his decision, while junior Mike Rosario and sophomore Patric Young have both announced their intent to return, according to a UF release. Young averaged 10.2 points and 6.4 rebounds per game this year and is proof his size  6-foot-9, 247 pounds  and athleticism. Boynton led the team in scoring at 15.9 points per game and would likely be drafted at the end of the second round, if at all. Rosario scored 6.6 points per game off the bench this season and probably ter overseas. If Florida were to return all of its underclassmen, the Gators would likely Erving Walker was UFs only senior, ed by incoming freshman guards Braxton Ogbueze, Michael Frazier and Dillon Graham. Of teams that reached the Elite Eight, only Kentucky, Ohio State and North Carolina also had just one senior playing However, all three of those schools project to lose underclassmen to the draft, with North Carolinas Harrison Barnes, Kendall Marshall and John Henson already declaring. Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator. org. HOOPS, from page 13Boynton season. According to NCAA Proposal No. 2010-24, the rule is intended to help keep student-athletes focused on academics in the spring term and to give coaches a better idea of their roster for the coming year before the recruiting period is closed. Some coaches like Kentuckys John Calipari have made the rule perfectly clear. Its the dumbest thing ever, Calipari told ESPN.com. Its stupid. If this is about the kids, then thats the last thing this is about. After returning to Gainesville from a trip home to St. Louis, Beal stated Sunday night that he intended to take the majority of the month to make his decision. In the intermittent period between now and April 29 at 11:59 p.m., hell probably discuss again his future with the Gators with coach Billy Donovan, who of course had Magic in 2007. Donovans return to the college ranks at Florida came $27 million contract to become the Magics new coach on May 31, 2007. After testing the NBA coaching waters, Donovan was released from his contract on June 6, 2007. even a shred of the same courtesy anytime soon? Because whether its Florida, an NBA team, agents or fans, everyone wants to know as soon as possible what theyll be getting on Beals birthday come June 28.

So far this spring, Muschamp has been pleased with the downthe 6-foot, 201-pound Pittman has brought to the offense, saying the freshman is passing some guys on the depth chart. He understands every-down performance, blocking and doing things you got to do to be successful, and reading coverages and seeing coverages, Muschamp said. He goes out and makes plays. Gillislee locked in: Last week Muschamp said running back Mike Gillislee was on pace to shore up the No. 1 spot in FloriMonday morning, the Gators coach said Gillislee has all but locked up the job. Mike has distanced himself to be that guy, Muschamp said. Given Gillislees history of injuries during his time at Florida, Muschamp cautioned that the Gators need to establish depth behind the senior. As a result, Gillislees touches will be limited during the last week of spring practice, while the likes of Omarius Hines, Mack Brown, Trey Burton and Hunter Joyer see more snaps out of the We need to start creating some separation there because when you get in the season those reps, practice reps become hard for everybody to get, Muschamp said. Quarterback update: As Driskel and Jacoby Brissett continue to battle for the starting quarterback role, Muschamp said Monday there still has not been any separation between the two sophomores. According to Muschamp, both have done a good job of managing the offense in practice, and he doesnt believe he will name a starter at the end of spring practice. Were going to go into the fall camp, Muschamp said. That, to me, is becoming more and more evident every day that theyre both guys we can win with. Bottom line, thats good for us. Injury report: Wide receivers Stephen Alli (groin), Solomon Patton (groin) and JaJuan Story (ankle) were all expected to return to practice Monday after missing much of the last two weeks, Muschamp said.

After resting during Floridas second bye period, Dickerson recorded a 9.9 on vault to help the Gators make a furious rally to the top of the leaderboard. Although she took a hop back on her landing, she said it was much better than taking an extra step. I just kind of did what I usually do in practice on vault, Dickerson said. What weve been working on is trying as hard as we could to get the landing. She struggled on bars to close out the competition, scoring a 9.75 after hitting her foot on the bar before taking a step on her dismount. Despite the low score, Faehn said she was impressed with Dickersons bars routine. She went too hard for the stick, so she came up short because she opened it up a little early, Faehn said.

16, ALLIGATOR TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 2012 PREVIEWING THE ORANGE AND BLUE DEBUTWith the Gators annual spring game, the Orange and Blue Debut, scheduled for this Saturday, we at alligatorSports want to get you prepared. Each day this week, we will follow as the spring season comes to a close. Today, we look at the offense under new coordinator Brent Pease, the inside run game and the A.C. Leonard situation. SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR DURING SATURDAYS GAME: 4. Brent Peases new offenseWhile the offensive gameplan for the spring game is generally very vanilla, Florida is in a unique situation this season in that there isnt much settled on that side of the ball, meaning there is plenty of work to be done in a simulated game environment. Both sophomore quarterbacks need plenty of reps and the same can be said for the inexperienced stable of running backs. There isnt a proven receiver in the bunch, and theres still several newcomers to work into the fold. Plus, the Gators need all the time they can get to adjust to Pease and his new wrinkles, as the said that he plans to utilize in UFs offense the motion and misdirection that made Boise State so successful. While much of the playbook hasnt changed and Pease isnt reinventing the wheel, Floridas players have plenty to adjust to in terms of pre-snap reads and motions. During Saturdays game, look to see how much Pease and the Gators actually show, and how cleanly the offense executes. Last season, the AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: 4. The inside run gameWe know you have heard it a million times already, but season without its two best backs from a year ago. While the departures of Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey obviously leave a gaping hole in terms of production, the Gators run game could actually improve through addition by subtraction. For all their talent, Demps and Rainey struggled running the ball between the tackles, especially against the top teams in the Southeastern Conference. In six losses, Florida averaged 61.8 rushing yards per game (76.5) and was out-gained in all but one. Based purely on measurables, Mike Gillislee, Mack Brown, Omarius Hines and incoming freshman Matt Jones all possess greater straight-ahead ability than Demps or Rainey. The offensive line has been a focus of increased physicality, and well, girth, which should theoretically help open holes in the run game. With either Jacoby Brissett or Jeff Driskel leading the offense, the Gators will need all the help they can get from the run game.Pease Gillislee STORYLINE TO WATCH: 4. A.C. Leonard and The Florida WayWill Muschamp made a big fuss in his intro ductory press conference about cleaning up the program he inherited. Under Urban Meyer, Florida developed a reputation for fostering a criminal atmosphere and failing to punish wrongdoers. Muschamp made waves initially with the dismissal of Janoris Jenkins and the shoo ing out of several others who were clearly up to no good, but pickle. Leonard was arrested in February after an allegedly Muschamp hardly had anything to say at the time of the arrest, releasing a statement through the university, saying, This behavior will not be tolerated. Leonard was suspended at the time, but he has since returned to practice and could play Saturday in the spring game. Muschamp has said that Leonard is not out of the woods yet and still has to earn his spot back, but is that really enough? Leonard Shawn Janetzke / Alligator Staff
