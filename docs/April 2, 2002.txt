Jeb Bush to veto a bill that would increase telephone rates. Butterworth said the measure would be particularly troublesome for those on fixed incomes. "It is nothing but bad news for millions of Florida consumers," Butterworth said. The bill passed the House 103-12 and the Senate 26-9, and a spokeswoman said Monday that the governor's office, has yet to receive the bill. Bill supporters, however, said it would increase competition in the local market and ultimately benefit customers. By allowing local phone service companies to raise their rates, they then would be required to reduce the amount they charge long distance carriers for access to phone lines. The long distance companies would then, in turn, pass savings along to customers in lower long distance rates. The idea is that more expensive local service would be offset by cheaper long distance. AROUND THE NATION Coca-Cola developing vanilla version of classic ATLANTA (AP) -Coca-Cola is reportedly developing a vanilla-flavored version of its best-selling flagship cola, extending the company's palette of flavorings. from Cherry Coke and Diet Coke with lemon. The nation's largest soft drink company has.prepared samples of packaging for the new drink, which wilbe sold initially only in North America, according to Beverage Digest. Coke officials declined to comment on the report. "It' is not yet an absolute certainty, but I think it's very likely that they'll launch a line extension of Coke Classic,"-Beverage Digest editor John Sicher said Monday. "It's become very clear in the last year or two that new products and innovation are an important component of marketing and drives growth." Regardless of how it might taste, vanilla offers Coke Classic something its managers have been hunting fervently the past few years -buzz. But don't expect to see a vanilla-flavored Pepsi anytime soon.

6, ALLIGATOR, TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2002 independent florida alligaor Founded in 1906 Independent since 1973 We Inform. You Decide. Jenny L. Allen Editor Jason Brown Mark Ward Editorial Board EDITORIALS Survey says If Florida voters have shown anything the past few years, they have shown their complete lack of ability to do anything correctly. The latest poll conducted by The St. Petersburg Times and The Miami Herald proves that. Some of the results of the survey are staggering. They point to a troubling lack of information or logical thought on the part of the state's voters when it comes to the gubernatorial candidates. Even though a majority of the state's voters claim to be unhappy with the way Gov. Jeb Bush has handled education and public schools, with 56 percent of voters in favor of a system similar to the now-defunct Board of Regents and 53 percent being against school vouchers -exactly the opposite of two of Bush's biggest education initiatives -56 percent of voters think he's doing a good job, and he holds a comfortable lead against his two main competitors, Janet Reno and Bill McBride. What's even more unusual is -although more than half the people polled don't even know who McBride is -he does almost as well against Bush as Reno does. Bush leads Reno 54 to 37 percent and leads McBride 55 to 34 percent. Incidentally, Reno leads McBride in the Democratic primary, 48 to 18 percent. So, let's crunch all these numbers. People love Jeb, even though they hate what he has done with education and disagree with his ideas concerning the Board of Regents and school vouchers. We find that odd, seeing as the poll also stated Florida's voters have listed education as their top hot-button election issue, going as far as showing their willingness to have their taxes raised in order to help improve schools. Plus, even though the people don't know who McBride is and said they rather vote for Reno in the Democratic primary, both of them would go down in roughly the same amount of flames if they tried to challenge Bush who, regardless of his horrible track record with the issue Florida voters care the most about, is sitting pretty. There's an old saying -the numbers never lie. If that's true, Florida's voters need to get more informed and start thinking more clearly in concerns to this election. Express yourself A 14-year-old Hillsborough boy recently was held down by two people while they shaved off his afro. Disturbing, right? It gets better. The two people responsible for this act were teachers at the middle school he attends. He said the two came in and told him he needed a haircut. He disagreed. They didn't care. Needless to say, the boy's mother has retained the services of a lawyer to look into the matter. While this episode is a bit extreme, it does point to a larger problem -the court-mandated violation of people's right to free expression by schools across the country. Courts nationwide have given schools free reign to regulate how their students dress and style their hair, hiding behind the premise that it improves discipline and learning. The very idea that someone's afro could serve as some kind of impediment to learning is so ridiculous it's funny. The thought that cutting someone's afro off or making someone take the pink or red or green streaks out of their hair will make them less of a threat to schoolwide discipline is preposterous. Surely, with the abysmal quality of schools in this country, there are better things to worry about than the color of little Suzy's hair. The ALLIGATOR encourages comments from readers.

As I listened to and spoke the words calling for freedom for all people, I wondered why Israel, the Jewish state, can't put that prayer into practice when it comes to Palestinians. The next morning, I read the paper. Suicide bomber, Pesach Seder at a Netanya hotel, more people dead. Oh, the irony -killing people in the name of liberation, while they are gathered to celebrate liberation. A great strategy, if your goal is to get as many Jews as pissed off as you possibly can. Maybe the bomber thought his self-sacrifice might scare the Israeli government into pulling out of the occupied territories. It would have been a misguided belief, but a possible one. Maybe he was just pissed off enough to think it worthwhile to sacrifice his life for revenge. So now the Israeli government is pissed off. Well -more pissed off. And they're invading Ramallah and other parts of the occupied territories, killing more Palestinians. And clearly that was a great idea, too. It totally stopped two more people from blowing themselves up to kill more Israelis on Sunday. But logic doesn't seem to have much to do with the cycle of retaliation that has been a factor throughout the history of the state of Israel. In Israel, Jews live with the fear that the next time they go out to eat or get on a bus or walk down the street, a bomb will go off and make it their last time to do so. In the occupied territories, Palestinians live with the fear that Israeli soldiers will show up on their sloorstep or stray artillery will find its way into their homes. The views expressed here are not When people are in breathing all that fear supporting terrorists or soldiers who happen to be on "our" side doesn't seem like a bad idea. Meanwhile, some continue to resist the vio, lence on both sides. The number of refuseniks Israeli soldiers who refuse to serve in the occupied territories on ethical grounds -is on the rise, up to 383 as of Sunday afternoon. Foreign peace activists in the occupied territories are risking their lives to act as human shields in Palestinian communities and in Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah. The Foreign Press Association is protesting Israel's attempt to keep the press out of Ramallah. SARI KROSINSKY U-WIRE One of the earliest things I remember reading in a Haggadah -the book used for Pesach Seders -is "None of us are free until we are all free." Even in the heart of fegr, some still remember the spirit of the exodus. Some still remember to care for the strangers in our land because we too were once strangers in a foreign land. Someone was telling me the other day about an interview they saw, done with two random, run of the mill people. One was Israeli. The other was Palestinian. After they were each interviewed separately, they were then brought together and discovered that they got along pretty well and agreed on a number of things. At the end, the interviewer said that if the peace negotiations were left up to these guys, a deal would be hammered out by the end of the week. Sari Krosinsky is a student at the University of New Mexico. This column first ran in the Daily Lobo. necessarily those of the Alligator.

4" -it WV) Art can never b accurately defined Editor.. In a beautiful disply of irony, Dael Priest answers his own question his MQndayletter to the Alhtator titled "Student art piece failed to impres,". He asks how egotistical can one person be? Well, not much more egotistical than one claiming to know exactly what is and isn't art. Apparently, Priest has insight that has eluded scholars and philosophers for centuries. Honestly, how can one define art? Its lack of definition is one of its most defining characteristics. I'm not saying Priest had to enjoy Richard Jacques' piece. Truthfully, it didn't grab me either. Regardless, I do see it as art, good or bad. Either way, it is Still art Only ask thetfs respct. -the itf oti6us aturi of art. Hesays that Jacques' work disgraces other artists who"create somethig Art isnt about creating a physical object. That is secondary.To say that is to saymusicians .are not artists. That idea, I'm sure, many would contest. Also, if Priest is going to continue his stance as the definitive art critic, I hope he learns some better ways to express his disdain other than calling it crap and the artist a moron. Maybe it is just me, but those are two approaches that act more to lessen his argument than support it. Jon Simon Suarez 3LS only the t d tWe'd liitothank the Alligtorfor the continued cover-age of.

James said she hopes to unify the dichSenate'sheCampus Cl _C.. ,, a m,,t thrnouh volunteer work. w said has o sanderson@alligator.org In the first meeting of Student Government's new legislative body tonight, senators will decide who they want to lead them for the next term. The Ignite and Swamp parties both have named their candidates for Senate president and president pro tempore. The president pro tempore, the chamber's second-in-command, runs the Replacement and Agenda Committee, which sets Senate meetings and makes recommendations for appointments. The president runs the meetings and serves as Senate spokesman. Although Swamp controls the Senate by a narrow margin, Swamp Senate presidential candidate Robby Jones said he "I surely hope they listen to our speeches and what other people have to say about us," he said. "I hope -they will not be influenced by outside sources." Ignite's candidate, Kim James, said she believes some senators will vote strictly along party lines, but she, too, hopes senators will look at the individual candidates instead of the party affiliations. "I want them to see what I've done, and hopefully they'll come aboard," said James, who served as president pro tempore this semester. "I feel the senators are very ethical, and the will look beyond party lines and see who's better qualified." Swamp took 20 seats in the Spring election, while Ignite took 19. Neither side could say which way the 40 Fusion Party By "fighting for a greater cause -such as an adopted charity -James said the senators would show they can do more than argue in Senate chambers. Jones said he would like to sit down with party leaders to discuss ways to overcome partisan differences. "We can't afford to be split down party lines, or our main goal of serving the students is lost," he said. Jones said he also wants to make SG more accessible by updating the SG Web site. He said he also hopes to add e-mail links to the site so students can better contact their representatives. James wants to focus on diversity, one of Ignite's main platform issues. partiCularly tate o itten off track Swamp also is putting forward Hooker for the position of presided tempore.

Two committee stops are planned for the measure in the Senate with the earliest chance for a floor vote coming Thursday. *50Â¢ DRAFTS: S$2IMPORTS TUESDAY 9pro-2am :JP GATORs *1605 SW 13TH ST* 20 Same Day Service / No Extra Charge MIM~tCSince NINA'S 1972 Professional Alterations & Tailoring 1636 W.

UF pfesssticide'' ly Tracy Swwkt Alligator Staff Writer tswar@a~figator-Org While cleanup crewsprepareto pump a toxic gas mto two northern postal facilities closed for anthrax, one UF researcher believes he has found a cheaper and more effective approach to eradicating the deadly bacteria -a common pest control agent. Rudolf Scheffrahn, a UF entomology professor, believes methyl bromide -a pesticide used to control insects, weeds and rodents -is more stable than chlorine dioxide, which may damage electronics, fabrics and photographs. "Methyl bromide is not reactive;,it's not an oxidizer like the other gas," Scheffrahn said. "It won't tend to harm things." Scheffrahn and Mark Weinberg, general manager of Cobra Termite Control in Lauderhill, tested the pesticide's efficiency by placing 80 paper strips with 100 million bacteria spores on them in a furished research center in Fort Lauderdale. The strips were loaded with Bacillus subtilis, an anthrax-related spore, and incubated at UF's dental school. "We put them in challenging locations throughout the buildingunder the carpet, computer key boards," Scheffrahn said. "We found we could kill anthrax spores at the [Environmental Protection Agency]'s standards." The entomologist also promotes the chemical's cost-efficiency, claiming methyl bromide fumigation would have cost a quarter less than the $23 million spent on sterilizing the Hart Senate Office building in Washington, D.C. That cleanup ran into some problems when the Office of Attending Physician logged more than 50 complaints of illnesses related to the noxious gas after the building reopened in January. But methyl bromide has some drawbacks. The pesticide has been found to deplete ,the. Earth's ozone layer and. production will be elm ated by 2005. Scheffrahn is not worried, though. The EPA has apIproved meth-yl bromide for anthrax decontamination in emergency situations. The agency issued a crisis exemption for the limited sale, distribution and use of the pesticide, primarily by UF and Cobra Termite Control, which provides money for the research. "The safety and effectiveness of methyl bromide are the main considerations, and the UF research will help provide this information," said Jeff Kempter, senior adviser at EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs, in a press release. Scheffrahn hopes the pesticide will be used to decontaminate the American Media Inc. building in Boca Raton, which remains closed after the first anthrax attacks. Gerald McKelvey, an AMI spokesman, said methyl bromide fumigation is a possibility, but it's too premature to determine. "I would imagine almost anything would be considered," McKelvey said. "We want something that will do the job without unfortunate side effects." Scheffrahn has studied methyl bromide for 17years and now shares with Weinberg a ending patent on using methyl bromide to eliminate deadly spores. Cobra Termite Control,the largest fumigation companion South Florida, would deontnate the buildings. ThercoianY has contributed $30, to the methyl bromide project tus far.

Jeb Bush made a controversial move to restructure the educational system in Florida, moving all schooling under a super Board of Education, dictating policy and creating separate boards for every university. Hisplan was to decentralize decision making on policy issues, and to give schools the power to determine teir own budgets. "Right now schools are competing with each other for funds," Skelton said. "UF employs 12 lobbyists in Tallahassee to try and get as much money as they can.' The governor's office did not return phone calls asking for comment. Under the previous governance structure, the universities were overseen by the state Board of Regents, which created the schools' budgets and did all the employment bargaining for faculty members. The survey, conducted by The St. Petersburg Times and The Miami Herald, shows the plan by Bush, who is approaching a gubernatorial re-election, doesn't sit well with voters. However, the majority said they still would support him in November. Bush's system decentralized the power to spend money and Skelton said that resulted in multiple voices squabbling with each other over who gets the money tagged for education. She said a constitutional system wouia centrauze power anu reso that problem: "The Regents would look out for A best interests of the university Skelton said.

Surgery resolves obesity problems Cont. i ing Witer Orlando resident Tammy Meehan dropped out of college, missed family functions and "didn't want to be seen in public"because she was embarrassed. of her weight. She gotup every morning and thought to herself, "Oh God, I'have to live another day being fat." At age 27, Meehan weighed 297 pounds. As the mother of three boys she tried every diet to lose the weight she hadgaied from her pregnancies. None worked. "Mywhole life was governed by weight," Meehan said. "I couldW't even go outside and play with my kids." But Meehan lost 40 pounds in one month, with no thanks to Weight Watchers or Slim-Fast. In August 2000, Meehan underwent bariatric surgery to combat her ongoing battle with morbid obesity. The United States leads the world in obesity -more than 50 million Americans suffer from this disease. Aclcording to the American Obesity Association, it is the second-cause of unnecessary deaths and costs the country more than $100 billion a year. "Obesity is a real problem and has the potential to become as bad as smoking," said Dr. W. Robert Rout, Chief of General, Gastrointestinal and Laparoscopic Surgery at Shands Hospital. Meehan had seen many doctors and realized something had to be done, especially after she was diagnosed with a heart valve defect.from the dietary supplement Fen-Phen Meehanwas the perfect candidate for bariatric surgery, as o called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass..

~,ALUJGATO1I TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2002 $enior overcomes life of struggles to lead Marland The Assodted Press ATLANTA -For more than 20 minutes, Juan Dixon was nearly invisible, a little man lost in the cavernous Georgia Dome. Then, when Maryland, needed him most in the NCAA championship game, Dixon knocked down two of the biggest shots of the night against Indiana. No way he was going to let this title get away from the Terrapins. Dixon endured too much heartache in his life, losing both parents to the drug culture. He Imard too many people say this skinny kid couldn't make it at a big school such as Maryland. When the Terps were reeling, Dixon was there for them -just as he had been all season. The All-American guard scored 18 points and made five steals Monday night to propel Maryland to its first national title, 64-52 over Indiana. After going 20:22 without scoring, Dixon made a 3-pointer that put Maryland ahead to stay with 9:40 remaining, erasing the only lead the Hoosiers had all night. Then, with the look of a man on a mission, Dixon sank a fadeaway jumper over his designated stopper, Indiana's Dane Fife. Maryland steadily pulled away from that point, overcoming a sloppy performance that threatened to ruin its first appearance in the championship game. "I was patient and let the game come to me," Dixon said. "I can't put into words what this feels like." When the horn sounded, he hurled the ball into the air and collapsed to the court between teammates Lonny Baxter (260 pounds) and Tahj Holdet (247). Somehow, Dixon's 165-pound body held up in the human sandwich. "I may be small, but I'm not weak," he said a day before the game. "I may be 165, but don't let it fool you." Dixon scored I11 points in the first 10 minutes, then Fife clamped down and Maryland struggled to get its dynamic transition game in gear. Dixon was part of the problem, committing seven turnovers. Indiana's Jared Jeffries sent the huge crowd into a frenzy -it was definitely leaning toward the underdog -when he slipped inside for the basket that gave the Hoosiers a 44-42 lead with just under 10 minutes to go. The advantage lasted only 13 seconds; Dixon made'sure of that. Appropriately, a fan held up a sign when it was over: "Thanks Juan." Dixon can thank basketball for providing the refuge to escape his troubled life. His mother, Juanita, often used heroin in the bathroom when Dixon was growing up. His father, Phil, also was a heavy drug user and spent part of his life in jail. Both died of AIDS when Dixon was in high school. But he found peers who could improve the quality of his life, and avoided the temptation to hang out on the Baltimore streets that claimed his-: parents. "They got caught up in the wrong crowd," said Dixon, whose. parents' names, Nita and Phil, are tattooed on his left biceps. Dixon wanted to play at Maryland, but when he came to the school -at 6-foot-3, but weighing just 150 pounds -he was deemed too frail to survive in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Still, he finished as the leading scorer in the history of the program, passing such greats as Len Bias and John Lucas. With his college career over and the NBA awaiting, Dixon gave one of his biggest hugs to Maryland coach Gary Williams. "He took a chance on me," Dixon said. "I love him for that." .U ... ...

'~S ROTA~AJJL ~2QO~ ~S IWiP. ,YAG~31JT SPECIAL K antair.org t asevaul season kicks off time for relaxation ,. Summer has arrived. It doesn't matter that spring just officially began a few weeks ago. As far as Florida is concerned, it's summertime. Two signs told me it was summer. The first one was the sweat that covered my face and caused my shirt to cling to my body as I drove around in my non-air-conditioned car. The second sign was that I was able to come home and turn the television on to a Major League Baseball game. Monday was opening day for most major league teams, marking the beginning of a new season. For me, there is nothing more relaxing than being able to watch baseball in the afternoon. I don't know whether it is the pace of the game, the familiar voices on the telefRsion, the bright green fields or the combination of it all, but something about it gives me a feeling of comfort. During a time when tests and papers are starting to pile up, when it feels like you can't go on, here comes baseball to remind you to slow down and take it one day at a time because there's a long road ahead. Opening day represents just the first game of a 162-game trek that teams must make in a season, and the only way for players and teams to finish that journey is to play one game at a time. Each game makes up less than one percent of a team's season, and each game counts the same whether it is the last day or the first day. Yet, the buildup and anticipation for that first day starts months in advance. In some places, children skip school and igrents take off work to see this one game. For some teams, the-attendance on opening day will be one of the best, if not the best, attendances of the year. In comparison, the National Hockey League and National Basketball Association's first games go relatively unnoticed -hidden by the shadows of football season. 1 But baseball's opening day is able to steal some of the spotlight from the NCAA men's basketball championship and the NHL and NBA playoff races. That's' because this day represents ore than the start of the baseball sean. It represents the arrival of sunny warm weather, laid back days and vacations. So really it's no wonder that people feel strong excitement and enthusiasm when they hear those famOus two words r he i ie Iothe year. Th waiting, Is over.

G IORS UEDA, P I ,20 Versatility becomes corner's By Jill Martin Alligator Writer jmartin@alligator.org It might have been April Fool's Day, but UF's defense saw right through the offense. Instead, Monday's football practice was highlighted with several interceptions, including two by cornerback Vernell Brown. "Vernell is a great athlete," cornerback Keiwan Ratliff said. "A lot of people kind of say bad things about him because he's small and he's short, but pound for pound, Vernell is one of the best athletes on this team." Brown has caught Coach Ron Zook's eye more than once this spring. The head ball coach said he has been impressed with Brown this spring and has also been a recent conversation topic with defensive assistant Mike Woodford. The topic concerned the possibility of switching him back and forth on offense and defense. "He's shown that he's a competitor," Zook said. "I like what I see. He's not as big as maybe you'd like him to be, but I think he's a guy that's going to play a lot of football around here." Linebacker Reid Fleming and Ratliff also had one interception each. Ratliff credits Monday's abundance of pickoffs from settling in with the new formations the defense has learned and worked on repeatedly during spring practice. "Interceptions come with basically knowledge," Ratliff said. "If you feel comfortable in the coverages that you're running, you'll feel comfortable out there trying to go after the ball and attack. But if you're out there thinking, then you're not going to be on the attack mode." BOO WHO?: Zook has had a lot to think about ever since he replaced Steve Spurrier as the head ball coach at UF. However, one thing that hasn't crossed his mind is if the crowd will be supportive or not during Saturday's Orange and Blue game. "They're going to boo me in the spring game?" Zook said. "I haven't given any thought to it. To be honest with you there's a lot of things down the road that I haven't given a YES 59% NO 41% JOELkaimnn@nllia TI 1 11 Late stretch to prepare UF for postseason By Gregg Girvan Alligator Writer ggirvan@alligator.org The UF men's tennis team encounters a postseason primer in the next two weekends, with matches against three top-25 teams. Coach Andy Jackson said the matches were important in determining the Gators' seed in the NCAA Tournament. "I would think that a lot of these matches would probably be round-of-16 or quarterfinal type matches in the NCAA if you have a good seed," Jackson said. "I don't know what our seed would be because it is going to be determined in these next tough matches." Assistant coach Michael Hegarty likened the last four regular-season matches to the first in three final schedule segments, with the Southeastern Conference Tournament and the NCAA Tournament being the last two. STILL UNDEFEATED: The No. 1 UF women's tennis team defeated Auburn 4-0 at Auburn. The Gators (14-0, 8-0 SEC) played the game Monday as a makeup game for Sunday's .postponement. The match was stopped after UF reached the four points needed for victory. PRACTICE AND DEVELOPMENT: The focus in practice for the men has been on match strategy and mentality. The matches on the weekend have supplemented the Gators' fitness, allowing the team to focus on non-conditioning training. "I think the hardcore conditioning segments are behind us for this year," Hegarty said. As far as player development, Jackson said the upperclassmen are advancing Trisan Ma"er I Alligator Staff In his freshman year with the UF tennis team, Hamid Mirzadeh will be tested by the fatigue and pressure ol the season's final stretch for the first time. at a quick pace.

Zook has concerned himself solely with focusing on the spring and the off-season, but he has yet to meet with his players and discuss anything pertaining to the season that lies ahead. "I won't let myself think about the games," Zook said. PLAN IN PROGRESS: Zook had been wrest-ling with the idea of changing the format of the Orange and Blue game, but in the end, it seems there won't be much change after all. "We're going to have a game," Zook said. "It's not a definite format. We're going to split it up...the first team versus the second team a little bit." II ---.....Â•-i ---2 i:-:m L

ATLANTA star who stepped up and a 00lwund coach -a match made in Maryland, and good enough to turn the Terrapins into national champions. With All-American guard Juan Dixon snapping out of a scoring drought just in time, Maryland ended Indiana's magical tournament run with a 64-52 victory Monday night. This was the Terrapins' first appearance in a national championship game and the senior-laden lineup came through over the final 9:42, pulling away from the Hoosiers to become the fourth Weight No. I seed to win it all. Coach Gary Williams guided his alma mater from the depths of probation 13 years ago to the pinnacle of college basketball. He let his intense demeanor melt long enough to celebrate with his team, which featured four players who had "We had to really grind it," he said. "it took us a good 2 5 minutes before we really ran our offense. Not many coaches get a chance to coach three great seniors like this. It was a thrill for me to watch these guys work hard and get their reward." Dixon scored at least 27 points in four of the first five tournament games, including 33 in the semifinal win over fellow top seed Kansas. He started the title game at that pace, scoring 11 points in the opening 10 minutes. He didn't score again for 20 minutes. When he hit a 3-pointer with 9:42 to play, it gave Maryland (32-4) the lead for good at 45-44 and the Terrapins made sure even a small lead was safe this time. I was trying to be patient," he said. "I was trying to let the game come to me. I hit a big shot." Dixon finished with 18 points and he and lfellow, senior Lonny Baxter -cot*.bined forallthepoints intihe 9-2run that Dixon started with the 3 'and Baxter enided with a.dunk that made it 51-46 with 7:22 to play. 'It's like I'm dreaming right now because I'm part of a-national championship team,' Dixon said. 'A lotof people at home counted me out. But I got better each year." Indiana (25-12), which upset top-seeded Duke then shocked second-seeded Oklahoma in the semifinals, just couldn't come up with another stunner. The team that had thee country almost forgetting about Bob Knight, again used the 3-point shot as its main weapon.
