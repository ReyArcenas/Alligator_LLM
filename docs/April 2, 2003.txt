Students rally to support minority admissions By Laura Metif Alligator Staff Writer hlnerritt@alligator.org As-lawyers for the University of Michigan argued in front of the nation's highest court that a minority admission policy does not establish quotas, a group of about 50 UF students and faculty rallied outside of Tigert Hall. The group, organized by Omega Phi Psi Fraternity, hopes UF officials will speak out in support of the system used at UM. Minority students at UM can receive up to 20 points on a 150-point admission scale because of their race. After three white students were denied admission, they appealed the decision, claiming that minorities were receiving -preferential treatment. At UF, the fraternity organized several speakers for Tuesday's rally and plans to present 1,000 signatures supporting affirmative action to UF President Charles Young by next Tuesday. "Affirmative action is inthing that needs to be uphek said Barbara McDade, of the-Association of Black Faculty and Staff at U". As long as race is a factor in excluding people ... it should be a factor in including Americans." Event organizers said they were disappointed that no one from the administration besides Dean Jon Mills of the Levin College of Law attended the rally; however, Provost David Colburn wrote in an e-mail that he was unaware of the rally and DAVID L/IL I ALUGAIUE SAFF Sharletta Roberts, Lori Nazry and Yohance Pettis-listen as Chris Chestnut speaks about gender issues i~ affirmative action in front of Tigert Hall on Tuesday afternoon. Omega Psi Phi organized the event ahd passed around a petition to get UF President Charles Young to take a stand for affirmative action. had been in meetings most of the day. Still, he said UF remains committed to diversity by following the statewide Talented 20 college admissions program implemented by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2001. The Talented 20 ,program strives to be race-neutral by admitting the-top 20 percent of each Florida high school's graduating class into a state university. "Our minority numbers were up significantly this year due to heavy recruiting and convincing students that UF was a place that welcomed students from all backgrounds," he said. In 2001, the first year after the program, only 490 black students were in the freshman class, down from 829 the previous year; however, this Fall the number of black students increased to 659 students. Mills said he thinks the imrovement is based on strong eforts to recruit minority students. "I think the record of the president and provost at UF in encouraging diversity is terrific," he said after the rally. "The commitment is clearly evident." The lack of minority scholarships, which were discontinued as part of Bush's One Florida Initiative in 1999, provides a hurdle for some minority students, Mills said. He suggested that the university try to work within Department of Justice regulations to provide more financial assistance to underrepresented students. David Bynes, coordinator of Greek life, attended the rally be-cause he advises the group and because he said he enjoys political issues. However, the fact that affir mative action has not become a campus issue worries him, he said. "Besides the Association of Black Faculty and Staff, affirmative action has really been a hush-hush issue, which is probably cause for alarm." Ronnie King, a computer engineering and mathematics se nior, who helped organize the rally, told attendantsthat it is unfair for UM to stop giving points on race but to continp1e giving points for other aspe4n6. "The only points they want removed are those for color," he said. ""Why don't they tell the son whose parents donated $100 million to the university that it doesn't matter? Let's leave legacy points, but take points from minorities." At the Supreme Court, justices aggressively questioned lawyers, focusing on likely consequences of discrimination and educational opportunities. It was the first time in 25 years that the court had taken up the polarizing question of racial preferences in admissions. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

ACROSS THE STATE Cuban group hoping to drum up more protests MIAMI (AP) -A leading Cuban exile group Tuesday denounced a crackdown by the Cuban government on dissidents in the communist nation, and said it would help organize a campaign of public protest to press for the release of all olitical prisoners on the island. The Cuban government has jailed dozens of activists, members of political opposition groups and independent journalists since last month on grounds they were conspiring with the United States to undermine the government. "They have tried to take advantage that world opinion and the press are concentrated on the war in Iraq," said Omar Lopez Montenegro, who monitors human rights issues in Cuba for the Cuban American National Foundation. Montenegro said somee relatives have asked the Miami-based group to help drum up international support to free their loved ones. The effort, dubbed "Campaign for an International Day of Struggle," involves a letter-writing campaign asking the Cuban government to free the dissidents and will culminate in what the foundation hopes will be worldwide protests on April 28. "This campaign is going to ask for the release, not only for the group that has been detained in the last few days, but also for political prisoners in Cuba ... people who have been in jail or years or months," Montenegro said. Montenegro said the foundation last week sent $50 each to 30 families of jailed activists, money that can be used to hire a defense attorney, he said. The foundation said more than 100 people were targeted in the wave of arrests that began March 18. Montenegro said 15 were released after 12 hours but 83 remained jailed. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation has said 78 people have been arrested. AROUND THE WORLD Another attempted sulcide, at Guantanamo Bay SANJUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) Aircraft launch crew stand along side the catapult as an F-14 Tomcat is launched from the USS Theodore Roosevelt. A terror suspect attempted suicide at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and was being treated at the detention camp's new psychiatric ward, officials said Tuesday. Guards saved the man within seconds of the attempt in his cell late Monday, Army Lt. Col. Barry Johnson said. There have been 24 suicide attempts by 17 individuals since detainees began arriving at the remote naval base in eastern Cuba in January 2002, officials said. No one has been successful. He said that the detainee did not suffer "significant injury" and remains under observation in the psychiatric facility, which opened March 23. The new ward has 20 detainees staying there, he said. Officials have denied that the 35-bed ward was created solely in response to suicide attempts, saying it is part of planned improvements to health care. volume 96 ISSN 0889-2423 number 132 a lI the independent florida aligator Not officially associated with the University of Florida Published by Campus Communications Inc., of'Gainesville, Fla.

Senators discuss alternatives to funding s By Apl Slmps Afligotor Writer asimpson@alligator.org The prospects of funding a controversial Nakba '48-sponsored speaker forced Student Government senators to question if the bill and proposed amendments were within their jurisdiction and if the speaker's message would incite an anti-Israeli sentiment. After close to an hour of debate, Nakba '48, which has self-funded two previous speakers whose events drew up to 300 students, received the requested $838 in SG funding. Ramzy Baroud, a Palestinian-American who grew up in a Gaza Strip refugee camp, is scheduled to speak on his book "Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts" on -April 9. However, Baroud is prohibited from selling the book at the event. Sen. Alex Bond, who spoke in opposition to the bill, shared a picture of the Jenin refugee camp Baroud says lost 2,000 homes after a Palestinian massacre. Bond asked the group to question whether or not the village lost 2,000 homes and told senators that he would not support a speaker who delivered half-truths and lies. "Sadly, there is no way that I can prove to you that he is a good man with only the best intentions," said Laura Hammad, Nakba '48 vice president, who shared letters of recommendations from people who have already heard Baroud speak. Sens. Brian Aungst and Mike Schuster suggested Nakba '48 host a speaker with less controversy. But fellow senators cited an incident when SG funded $4,000 for a Black Student Union event to host Bobby Seale, founder of the Black Panther Party. Sen. Ysabel Cruz proposed an amendment to cut the speaker's honorarium, which was rejected, however, an amendment to prohibit the speaker from selling his book at the event was approved. Brent Gordon, Honor Court Chancellor-elect,lso s s -:, the issue. Gordon told the group that's a Jewish student, he does not agree with Baroud's opinions, but the issue would wind up in a court if senators chose not to fund the event. A resolution opposing the U.S. war on Iraq was removed from the SG Senate agenda on Tuesday, after Sen. Alan Rubin denied sponsorship and no senator volunteered as a replacement. Accent plans additional security for Clinton speech By April Simpson Alligator Writer asimpson@alligator.org When former President William Jefferson Clinton speaks at the O'Connell Center on Thursday, students will be greeted with standard event security, but additional Secret Service efforts will guard the premises. The event, which is free and open to the public, is sponsored by Accent, Student Government's speaker's bureau. Doors open at 3 p.m. and Clinton is scheduled to speak at 4:30 p.m. Darius Dunn, associate director of the O'Connell Center, said he expects a "capacity crowd" of 9,000 people to attend. The O'Connell Center seats about 12,000 people, and Accent generally seats its speakers in the center of the basketball court. However, because of increased security precautions, Clinton will be seated in a way so no one will be allowed to sit behind him. Accent took similar security precautions when former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev and former President George H. W. Bush spoke in 1999 and 2000, respectively. "This is a post-Sept. 11 [2001] era that we're living in," Accent director Eric Trabin said. "But we are in a state of war so that does take things into account." Joe Sharkey, University Police spokesman, said event security would have increased uniformed and plain-clothes officers. Both Dunn and Trabin said more than enough security officials would be working the event. Dunn said the bulk of the security preparations have included alerting staff to have their eyes open and keep aware of their surroundings. He said he wants patrons to feel comfortable without worrying about security issues. "These are very normal preparations when you have a president visiting, past or present," Dunn said, while adding that his staff has been in good practice with a state of heightened security since Sept. 11, 2001, and in even better practice since the war with Iraq became imminent. Trabin said students should remember that items brought to the event are subject to search. He said students are prohibited from bringing both book bags and large bags. Purses as well as small camera bags are not prohibited, and large cameras are permitted only by press officials. Gina Evans, Accent public relations director, said to consider the security measures comparable to a basketball game's. "We're using the same precautions for anything at the O'Connell Center," she said. ________________________________________ri S Be a Community Ambassador and we'll pay your rent!

4, IR DNEs canMEidsf Diverse candidates vie for new city Commsson rseat By Kimberly Jones Alligator Writer kmjones@alligator.org A carpenter, a local businessman and a student. The candidates for the new city conmission at-Large 2 seat, created after the Archer Road annexation, are as diverse as the residents they want to represent. Rob Brinkman, Rick Bryant and Adam Guillette agree on most of the big issues, but each feel they provide a different type of leadership from their opponents. Rob Brinkman comes from a different style of life. A carpenter, he works with his hands to make a living. He moved to Gainesville in 1996 and became involved in local politics by being on the Campaign Finance Advisory Board and as an executive member of the Sierra Club. He said issues like the Midtown Project, which was approved by the minority of an unelected board, are prime examples of why he's running. "There is a tendency in the way that procedures are set up in this town that there is very little notice of a project," Brinkman said. "But issues like this should be debated." If elected, he'd like to create a town hall forum where people could come and talk about issues without a time limit. Brinkman said he offers a clear choice from his opponents because of how many issues Guillete and Bryant agree on. In a questionnaire by the Builder's Association of North Central Florida, Guillette and Bryant answered 15 of the 18 questions the same. The three candidates answered four of the 18 questions the same. "I think you could just as well toss a coin on those two, but with me one can make a clear choice," he said. Since his son started playing sports five years ago, Rick Bryant noticed a lack of recreational facilities in Gainesville. With one of his three children about to enter middle school, he realized that after-school projects had remained underfunded from when he was a child growing up in Gainesville 32 years ago. With virtually no programs for middle school students, he saw many latchkey children in need of help. The lack of business development seen in the dying 13th Street corridor and Pick 'n Save plaza prompted him to make another run for city commission. Bryant unsuccessfully ran for the District 2 seat that was won by Commissioner Ed Braddy. He wants to coordinate between different organizations like the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club to get "bigger bang for our buck" with after-school activities. Bryant said he best represents the at-large district because of his Gainesville roots. "I've lived on both the east side and the west side of town. I think I've seen the transition of Gainesville," he said. Even though he's a 22-year-old UF student, Adam Guillette is no stranger to politics. While most students were basking in the sun this past summer, Adam Guillette was sweating in Trenton, Fla., trying to find a compromise between a police chief and a commissioner. He spent a Spring semester strapped into his inline skates going door to door to register more than 4,000 voters. Despite not considering himself much of a club-goer -he listens to Led Zeppelin and professes he can't dance -he worked against the rave ordinance because he felt it infringed on people's civil liberties. "I've been fighting for what I believe in nonstop for over a quarter of my life," he said. He's already been a Student Government senator, managed and edited The Gator Standard newspaper, worked on six comSTEPHEN BAMONTE I ALLIGATOR mission campaigns and ran unsuccessfully for mayor. "It's clear that I have more experience than any of the other candidates, and f think that's what Gainesville deserves." Senate prefers less strict version of voter-approved smoking ban By Jon Custer Alligator Staff Writer jcuster@alligator.org TALLAHASSEE -The state House of Representatives passed its version of the law implanting a voter-approved smoking ban Tuesday, but faces a challenge from the Senate, which prefers a looser interpretation of the amendment. The Clean Indoor Air Act, which implements the constitutional smoking ban, passed 93-23 with both objections Democratic and Republican. "This is the single most invasive private property rights issue that has ever been," said Rep. Dwight Stansel, D-Live Oak. "It's going to be a nightmare." Rep. Stacy Ritter, D-Coral Springs, also criticized the bill, saying it went further than voters intended. "I voted for Amendment 6, but this isn't the Amendment 6 I voted for," she said. Voters passed the smoking ban into the state constitution last November; leaving lawmakers to work out the details. The House version, which bans almost all smoking in indoor businesses, makes exceptions for tobacco shops and cigar factories, private homes, home-based businesses that don't deal with children or health care, and designated rooms at hotels. But it doesn't include an exemption for cancer research, drawing a complaint from Rep. Charlie Justice, D-St. Petersburg. "We're potentially outlawing some of the cancer researchthat's going on in the state," he said. The original amendment also incded an ptiUo fors daleba &U the Senate. amendment's sponsors said stand-alone bars only could serve pretzels and popcorn, while bar and restaurant owners wanted a percentage limit that would allow bars to serve full meals as long as they get most of their money from alcohol. The Senate's compromise -allowing smoking in any bar that earns less than 30 percent of its revenue from food -was heavily criticized by restaurant owners and smoking opponents. House Speaker Johnnie Byrd, R-Plant City, said.it would require an army of "smoke police" to enforce. However, the House decided to sidestep the debate and outlaw smoking in bars altogether, using a provision in the amendment that allows lawmakers to be stricter than the original language. "That way there is no controversy," said Rep. Manuel Prieguez, R-Miami, sponsor of the bill. "We thought that it was the cleanest, fastest, best way of implementing the language that is in Amendment 6." The Senate effort, led by-Senate President Pro Tempore Alex Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, which also bans smoking in outdoor seating areas, hasn't been voted on yet. But once the Senate passesit version, lawmakers will have to meet to rectify cant. differences betweenthe two." Byrd said the two chambers should beable to reach a compromisedespite his criticisms of the Senate smoking ban.

Alumnus to chair Nuclear Regulatory4 Byid g aato taro Alligator Writer szavattaro~alligator.org The safety of U.S. citizens' lives is in the hands of a UF alumnus. With-his appointment as chairman Of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Tuesday, Nils Diaz is responsible for essentially anything and everything concerning radiation. "The mandate of the commission is the protection of public health and safety, the environment and the common defense and security for all civilian uses of nuclear materials," said the UF Department of Nuclear and Radiological Engi'Star Search.' neering professor emeritus. "We are the ones that take care of making sure there is actual protection." Originally nominated for a position on the commission in 1996 by former President Bill Clinton, Diaz is replacing Richard Meserve, who vacated the post Monday. The U.S. Senate unanimously approved his nomination to the commission seven years ago and again in 2001 when President Bush reappointed him. "I considered it a bit of luck," Diaz said. The 1965 and 1969 UF graduate said citizens should not worry about nuclear reactors and facilities across the country during wartime because his group has taken several measures to elevate the security around nuclear materials. "We can assure the public that ai the measures that need to be taken have been taken," he added. Fellow Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Edward McGaffigan Jr. said Diaz is "uniquely qualified" fbr this line of work. "He obviously has the nuclear engineering background that allows him to talk at any level of technical complexity of nuclear power reactors and their safety features," McGaffigan said. "He's a national asset, and the University of Florida community should be very proud of him." He and Diaz both were approved for the group at the same timein 1996 -'Diaz as the Republican and McGaffigan as the Democrat. As federal statutes mandate, no more than three people on the five-person commission can be from the same party, McGaffigan added. Even in Washington, D.C., Diaz has. never forgotten UF and constantly tells stories of his days on campus. ."I am a Gator, and I look forward to coming in the Fall to a few of the games, which I always enjoy," Diaz said.."It has always been my pleasure to interact with the people of Gainesville. It will always be home." seeks Gai nesville talent through auditions By Stad Zavattoro Alligator Writer szavattaro@alligator.org Clad in shiny black pants and an oversized red, white and blue windbreaker, 16-year-old Traci Koch. stretched her muscles while waiting to perform a dance routine with a trio of friends. "We didn't sleep much on Sunday," she said about her foursome from Tampa, who call themselves Caliente. "We woke up this morning at 6 o'clock to come down here and wait in line." Koch, Justin Middlebrooks, Rachel Vollrath and Marlowe ,Howell waited at the UF Hotel and Conference Center on Tuesday for a chance to audition for the CBS show "Star Search." Koch said she and her friends were the only group of the six in the audition room that won a chance tohave their tape 'forwarded to "Star Search" executives, for review. UF sophomore Nicolette Skourellos, wearing a one-sleeved fishnet shirt under a bright pink tank top, also performed her dance routine for the audition cameras. .Although Skourellos has been dancing since age five and is a member of UF student dance group Danza, she said she still ad some 'difficulties choreographing her "thrashy jazz" routine Monday night. "It's so much pressure, and you DAVID LLNIL I ALLIGAIUK bSAFF Rachel Vollratb, Marlowe Howell and Traci Koch; of the All American Dance Factory, warm up before auditioning for "Star Search" on Tuesday afternoon at the UF Hotel and Conference Center. have to put a certain amount of tricks and turns to show off your ability," she said. Although she did not hear if her tape made the cut, Skourellos said after her performance that it was an experience she will not soon forget. "You only get to try out for 'Star Search' once," she said. "How often does 'Star Search' come to Gainesville, Florida?" UF telecommunications junior LaKendra Tookes decided to belt out a few notes of Mariah Carey's "Vision of Love," but it was not enough to earn her a callback today. "I did not get the callback, but it was really cool," she said, adding that she messed up the song's ending. "It wasn't intimidating. There was a lot of talent in the room, and everyone was really nice." UF was the first stop on a cross-country bus tour that includes trips to the University of North Carolina, University of Kentucky, Ohio State University and UniYersity of Michigan. "This basically is a driving billboard," said "Star Search" associate Talent Producer Dj. Feldman of.the bus parked near Century Tower on Tuesday. "We wanted to l.et students know we were on campus." Feldman worked closely with fellow associate talent producer Dean Houser for the auditions that drew more than 500 people. He said the reality series is different from most out there because no one is insulted and contestants do not have to eat or do anything questionable. "Everyone has an audience," Houser said. "This isn't 'American Idol.' We don't criticize." People chosen as finalists from each city will be flown to Los Angeles for a chance to compete on the nationally televised, live version of "Star Search." "The little girl that won our first show, her family was living in a van," Houser said. "It's amazing what's happening."

When we struck Nagasaki and Hiroshima with atomic force less than four years later, Japanese citizens knew why and accepted our editing of their constitution. They were disillusioned by their leaders' warmongering, and ready for a change of pace. Post-war Japan was an ideal breeding ground for American democracy. When terrorists struck our country in 2001, we started swinging away at anyone who scared us: al-Qaida, Iraq, international students and insubordinate peace-loving liberals. When bombs started raining down on Baghdad less than two years after Sept. 11,2001, Iraqi citizens weren't sure why we were destroying their country. They didn't feel they'd done anything to deserve our wrath. For this and many other reasons, democracy in Iraq won't be easy. Iraq didn't attack us. We don't have the moral claim of self-defense we held fast to in World War II. We have a weak, unpopular excuse of pre-emptive defense that much of the world has ridiculed. Our offensive against Iraq has already had devastating effects on the people we claim we're liberating. Civilian casualties, in only two weeks, are in the thousands. Any feeling of gratitude the Iraqi people may have had toward us diminishes with every minute of bombing that rages on in their streets. Certainly many citizens would love to see Saddam Hussein's regime toppled, but if America is seen merely as the lesser of two evils, our post-war occupation only halfheartedly will be welcomed. Another factor in the Japanese acclimation to the American democratic utopia was our unmistakable victory. Our use of atomic bombs, though not necessarily a popular choice, certainly was effective in bringing an end to a bloody war and putting the Japanese in a submissive position when we laid down our demands. Iraq has our troops battling furiously against suicide bombers, sandstorms and soldiers in civilian garb. Though nearly everyone is assured we'll be victorious, an end to this war is less likely to bring a clear-cut victory. Already the message from Iraq has been mixed. Mass surrenders boosted our hopes in the first few days of fighting, but those surrenders have tapered off, and the fighting has gotten tougher. Unless Bushpulls out the big guns -which we certainly hope doesn't happen -our total defeat of.Iraq is a long shot. The Iraqi people will not quickly comply with our demands of disarmament and governmental restructuring-without our over-the-top victory. The process will be a long, trying one,with more civilian resistance than we bargained for. Anti-American sentiment in the region is high, thanks to years of crippling economic sanctions, our playground bully persona and the devastation our liberation campaign has caused thus far. Iraqis won't transform themselves overnight Under a democratic puppet government. That's not their culture. The Japanese have adopted a hodgepodge of international traditions, which made them more able to adapt to post-war change. In a few short decades, they've become an economic powerhouse and a major player in international politics. But we can't shock and awe Iraq into economic and democratic stability. If we keep bombing their marketplaces and factories, it'll be a while before we are buying toys with uMade in Iraq" labels.

Americans are apathetic to war We all have short attention spans. That's why we change the channel during commercial breaks, read the last page of our novels first, and pay for review sessions to teach us material that we didn't learn while sleeping through class. That's why -at least I tell myself that's why -moat people don't take the time to read this column. And this short attention span that our country has is why most us were wrapped up in the Oscars and the NCAA tournament while our troops were fighting. Why most of us watched the "Shock and Awe" for a couple of minutes only to realize that happy hour was about to start without us. That's why the average person has no idea that things aren't going as smoothly as Gen. Franks antd President Bush planned. We're going to win, rest assured, but the price might mean more in men and dollars than we had expected. Most people, myself included to a degree, only will see of the war what interrupts normal TV programming, and only read of it what is next to a gruesome front-page picture. There is nice weather for us to enjoy, graduation and summer rapidly approaching, plenty for us to worry about without constantly worrying about what goes on two oceans away. It's not a criticism of all of -us, just a fact. The fact is that I rarely watch Fox news to get updates about Operation Iraqi Freedom because new episodes of "South Park" or new pranks on "Punk'd" get in the way. That doesn't mean that I don't care, it just means that life goes on, and that as college students our attention can only focus on world conflict when it has time. It's not just college students. Americans are already pushing our war with Iraq to the back of their minds. Sure, when we're at the gas station or sitting next to a fatigued fellow student we remember, but then it's back to the daily grind. NICK WEIDENMILLER POLITICKED OFF This doesn't mean that we don't care, it doesn't mean that we're not patriotic, it just makes us people. It also makes it easier for our elected officials and military leaders to do their job, allowing them to communicate with one another instead of holding daily press conferences. Protests will continue to remind us how horrible we are for ignoring the conflict, for once again diverting our attention and becoming the silent majority. For once again being too concerned with our own bills, our own friends and family, our own lives to focus on our leaders' latest move on the northern front. For once again having a short attention span. The people we elected and the people they appointed are working around the clock so that the worst part of our day is looking for a parking spot or scuffing our Air Force One's. They are working around the clock so that at the end bf the day when Tom Brokaw interrupts "Friends,v everyone in the room can look at one another, as if to say, -oh yeah, there's a war on."

French are prey to special interests Editor:. I am not completely dismissing the points brought up in the piece called "America: Ease up on French" in the Points and Case section.Americans have been blinded by utter rage from the Sept. -11, 2001 attacks and lash out at any force that does not wholeheartedly agree with a war that is extremely controversial in America. I am merely bringing to light the true reasons France did not support the war. If one will open a history book, they will find that France owned many Arabic provinces, now countries, such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia to name a very few. Therefore it would be intelligent to assume that there is a somewhat substantial amount of Arabs in France itself, 3 million to be exact. Five percent of France's population of 60 million is solid Arab. This is not including whatever percent is mixed and has strong Arabic roots. Politically, it would be complete suicide to agree with the United States and go to war with the Arab nations. Secondly, some of the Arabic .quarters in France have been known to erupt into riots and violent protests. Before judging the foreign front, view the opinions of America's public. A strong 24 percent of the population is against the war. Before lashing out at the usual scapegoat, France, view the polls of public thought. Steven Nedrud 1 LS Protesting war is anti-American Editor:. I am ashamed of some of my fellow Americans. According to Tuesday's poll by the Alligator, 60 percent of the voters do not think that protesting the war is anti-American. It parallels the question of whether one can protest the war and still be patriotic. I say it is not possible to do both. Granted, you are exercising your coveted freedom of speech, which seems to be the most overused excuse for anti-war protests. But freedom of speech has nothing to do with patriotism. Pro-war protests are, ironically, rather peaceful. But they do not get a lot of attention, and, of course, are not9 1 1 ble" as protesting t w* do not understaWd how soOpeople can be comfortablewt the fact that Iraqis are tortured and killed without reason by Saddam-Hussein.

8, ALLIGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2003 Lawyers speak to standingcrod a exerienc By Amy Pedman Alligator Writer aperlman@alligator.org Pregnant chads, extended deadlines and butterfly ballots are just a few of the things that helped two lawyers become the center of attention for 36 days. Dexter Douglass, a UF law school alumnus and chief Florida attorney for Al Gore, and Barry Richard, chief Florida attorney for George .W. Bush, spoke to a standing-room-only crowd Tuesday night at the President's Room in Emerson Alumni Hall. Richard said he received a call from Gov. Jeb Bush's staff asking him to represent his brother. He said he would have represented the other side if he had been asked. Douglass said at first he declined the offer to defend Gore because he did not want to interrupt his life, but then realized it was a wonderful experience to represent people he normally wouldn't defend. "No way would I have represented Bush," Douglass said. "I'm at the age where I don't need the money." Gore and Bush had two very different strategies, the lawyers said. Gore was extremely involved in his cases and at times overturned his lawyers' decisions, which may have ultimately led to Bush becoming president. Bush, however, had very few strategy meetings and left everything up to his lawyers, Richard said. Gore also decided to contest only four Florida counties instead of the entire state because he did not have the manpower and because he thought he could win in those four counties, UF oral history professor Julian Pleasants said. "We had young lawyers working all day and all night," Douglass said. The chief Florida attorneys for George W. Bush and Al Gore debated at Emerson Hall on Tuesday night. Barry Richard and Dexter Douglass debated while UF history professor Micheal Gannon moderated between them. Pleasants, who did a series of interviews with the two lawyers regarding the 2000 presidential election, helped organize the debate, which was part of the annual Augustus M. Burns Lecture Series, which brings high-profile speakers to campus. The two lawyers agreed that there was nothing illegal about the butterfly ballots andanother presidential election wouldn't have been legal. Richard said that although they argued opposing sides in court for 36 days, all of the lawyers actually enjoyed working together. "People watching the. trial on TV must have been surprised to see how well we all got along," he said. Douglass also said the smaller, less-publicized cases actually decided who would ultimately become president, not Gore v. Bush. "As an American you have to recognize the rule of law," he said. Equal Rights Amendment passes first vote in committee By Jon Custer Alligator Staff Writer jcuster@alligator.org TALLAHASSEE -Several Florida lawmakers want the state to take up an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ensure equal rights for women more than 20 years after the amendment's opponents thought they had defeated it. A bill to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, sponsored by Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Miami Beach, was voted on for the first time Tuesday, passing 6-2 -through a Republican-dominated Senate Judiciary Committee. "I was very gratified by the vote today," Margolis said. "There were some very thoughtful senators who I thought loudly said 'Yes.'" The ERA was first drafted in 1923 after women got the right to vote, and inspired a national debate in the 1970s between feminists and conservative groups, who feared the amendment would legalize abortions and gay marriages. Congress sent the amendment to the states for approval, but only 35 of the necessary 38 signed off before the 1982 ratification deadline set by the Supreme Court when Congress's 1979 deadline expired. But in 1992, Congress approved a 203-year-old constitutional amendment, setting a precedent that revived the hopes of ERA proponents, who are now trying to convince the last three states to ratify. "My personal opinion is it's kind of like a retro subject, like going back and wearing bell bottoms," said Gov. Jeb Bush last month, drawing criticism from women's groups. "I was disappointed," Margolis said of the remark. "The governor should be sensitive enough to understand that people want equal representation under the constitution." House of Representatives Speaker Johnnie Byrd, R-Plant City, said after talking to women he knows, he wasn't convinced of the need for the amendment. "You're going back and selecting slices of Americana and saying, 'You're entitled to special rights,'" Byrd said. Stefanie Lauria, co-president of the UF Campus National Organization for Women, said she and her organization felt the issue is still relevant. "We think it is going to help all of us," she said, adding that any legal challenge was hypothetical. "Once we get three states to pass it, then if Congress doesn't allow it, that's a whole other issui," she said. "For now I think it's worth the fight." Still, many opponents say the latest legal argument is flimsy. "I think that's a silly argument," said Phyllis Schlafy, founder of the Eagle Forum, which opposed the ERA in the 1970s. "You can't promote equality or fairness by doing something that's crooked along the way." SeOd itmia Letter.

WEDNESDAY, A StUdent wins national Harry S. Truman award By AmyPedman Alligator Writer aperlman@alligator.org A political science and sociology junior is one of 76 students nationwide being prepared for leadership in public service. Terri Porter won the Harry S. Truman Scholarship, which consists of a $27,000 scholarship for graduate school and a $3,000 scholarship for her senior year of college. Aside from winning the scholarship, Porter said she will most likely receive an internship in Washington, D.C., for next summer. She said one of the most valuable parts about receiving the scholarship is the resources and connections she will have. "It's exciting, and we've received overwhelming support from former Truman scholars," Porter said. Porter and the other Truman scholars will attend a weeklong leadership development program in May at the William Jewell College in Liberty, Mo. Former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis will speak about the winners' proposals at the conference. Renee Johnson, an assistant professor of political science, has worked with Porter on an academic project. "We share common interests both in and out of class," Johnson said about Porter winning the scholarship. "I'm thrilled but not surprised. It's fabulous for the university." She also said the two developed a friendship over the course of their time working together. Porter's project for Johnson's Political Data Analysis class involved juvenile justice, which also was the policy proposal she submitted as part of a requirement for the scholarship. She proposed to increase funding to communities supporting programs that follow children through each stage of development to prevent truancy. Porter, a member of Phi Mu Sorority, serves as the president of the Panhellenic Council and was the Florida coordinator of the Southeastern Panhellenic Conference. She was also Phi Mu's Greeks Advocating Mature Management of Alcohol representative and helped set up a designated driver program. "You would never know she does everything she does," Phi Mu President Jenny Ryan said. The winners were selected from 635 candidates nominated from 305 colleges and universities, Porter, UF economics junior Steven Cohen and political science junior Valerie Lynch were among the 212 finalists. Porter, who was the only student to win from the state of Florida, said she found out she won from UF President Charles Young two weeks ago.

10, A .IGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2003 Flight detained at San Jose airport after illness scare The Assodated Press SAN JOSE, Calif. -An American Airlines flight from Tokyo was detained on the tarmac at the San Jose airport Tuesday after five people on board complained of symptoms like those of the mysterious new illness spreading through Asia, health officials said. Two passengers and two crew members, plus a fifth unidentified person, complained of symptoms similar to those found in severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has afflicted hundreds in Hong Kong and killed at least 64 people worldwide. It was not immediately clear when the people became ill, only that they reported to the crew during* the flight that they "think they may have SARS," said Joy Alexiou, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. Alexiou added that "we're pretty sure four of the five transferred from Hong Kong to Tokyo." Three first-class passengers were taken to a hospital, airport spokeswoman Cathy Gaskell said. Bob and Barbara Beom of Grants Pass, Ore., said they were sitting near those passengers and they showed'no signs of sickness. 'It's an overreaction of some sort," Bob Beom said. Some passengers remained on the plane, but others were allowed to leave because health officials do not believe the disease is' contagious until. a person shows symptoms. Flight 128 from Tokyo to San Jose stopped on the tarmac short of the gate. Ambulances lined up near the plane as the 125 passengers and 14 crew members waited on board after the 10-hour flight. American Airlines notified the airport that help was needed after"the captain was informed of a passenger needing medical assistance," said Todd Burke, a spokesman for the airline. More than 1,600 cases of the illness have been reported so far worldwide, including 69 cases in the United States. None of the U.S. cases were fatal.I. Last week, evidence surfaced that SARS can be caught on airplanes. Hong Kong authorities said several tourists on a China Air flight caught the disease after flying with another SARS-infected passenger. Singapore Airlines said an attendant was sickened after traveling on a recent flight that carried an SARS-stricken doctor, and officials in Connecticut*said a suspected case there involved a college student who had gone overseas on Spring Break.

Fifteen of the program's 31 students are enrolled at Syracuse, the rest at other schools.

WEDNESDAY, APRi Pride Awareness Month2003 kicks off wi By Kuthqyn Woldeck Alligotor Contributing Writer The Pride Awareness Month 2003 observance opened Tuesday with the Pride Fest held on the Reitz Union North Lawn to promote awareness and educate students about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender lifestyles. The event featured a 30-foot climbing wall, an obstacle course and a space walk to attract people and encourage them to learn about the month, said Michael Roedel, Pride Student Union president. PSU members handed out pamphlets and were available to answer questions about this month's events and about the organization. "The event is definitely important to open people's eyes and see that they're a significant portion of the community, and that they need to be looked at the same way as everyone else," said sophomore Matt Leslie, a PSU member. The highlights of the month are "Road Rules" members Shane and Rachel on Friday, comedian Elvira Kurt on April 16 and America's Divas on April 17.

As a part of the month, today some UF students will take a vow of silence in honor of those who have died as victims of hate crimes. The event is a silent protest, said Allison Andrews, vice president of the organization. PSU has organized the day of silence for several years. Students participating will have cards that explain why they are not speaking to give to other people. "It's a way of standing up for our rights without saying anything at all," Roedel said.

V 12, ALLIGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2003 Scientists -at UF, UT find gene therapy for disease By Amy Gorin diatrics and genetics at the UT Medical Alligator Contributing Writer Branch at Galveston and the originator of the Brain tissue destruction caused by a rare genetic disorder is a step closer to being prevented. UF and the University of Texas at Galveston scientists have discovered a gene therapy to prevent the fatal tissue destruction caused by Canavan disease. Canavan disease is an inherited brain disorder that becomes apparent in 3to 9-month-old infants. Children with the disease start to regress and lose the ability to move their bodies and focus their eyes, said UF neuroscientist Ronald Mandel. He said the disease makes sufferers into human vegetables. "Some people would say they're better off dying than having to be fed their whole lives," Mandel said. "But these people are mostly existentialists. If we make it so they can walk, they might be able to walk off ledges or walk into traffic." Research has been conducted on mice, but it may take years to apply the therapy to humans, said Reuben Matalon, a professor of peHe expects to spend anywhere between two and five years continuing research on mice before he feels confident to perform research -on children with the disease. The mice used in the study have not been around long enough for scientists to project what behavioral problems might occur, Mandel said. "When we decide to [study humans] there's going to be no chance that we're going to hurt anybody," he said. While the UF and UT at Galveston scientists are performing their study on mice models, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia simultaneously has been performing research on humans, Mandel said. Matalon said because of rigid institutional guidelines, the hospital is probably being ethical in its research. Guidelines usually require procedures to be completely safe and not cause any infections or new diseases. Speech addresses lack of activity among aging ByParkkSnryth Alligator Contributing Writer Before giving a speech about increasing physical activity among the elderly, an expert in the field took a jog around Gainesville on Tuesday morning. Dr. Wojtek Chodzko-Zajko, a professor and head of the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told about 35 doctors and professors at the McKnight Brain Institute he noticed many sidewalks, bike paths and crosswalks that promoted physical activity. Because most cities are not like Gainesville, however, Chodzko-Zajko has led a coalition of more than 50 national organizations to develop a comprehensive agenda to increase physical activity with the elderly. The $20 million campaign relies on medical schools, doctors, marketing and city planners to reduce the number of sedentary older people, Chodzko-Zajko said. He said the program would combat an obesity epidemic that has 40 percent of the population more than 55 years old as sedentary. "Physical activity is not a fad anymore," Chodzko-Zajko said. "It is not something that people can do if they want to. There is really strong evidence to suggest that it is important for prevention, it is important for rehabilitation." Cities should look at readjusting zoning codes to allow stores to be built in neighborhoods and to improve accessibility for those who choose to walk, he said. Candice A.

WEDNESDAY, APRI Court. discusses question of p reference in admit ~..F~EF3 ~ The Assodated Press WASHINGTON -Supreme Court justices vigorously debated the role of race in higher education Tuesday in a pair of cases that could rewrite the rules for affirmative action on campus and beyond. The justices aggressively questioned lawyers, focusing on likely consequences of discrimination and educational opportunity. It was the first time in 25 years that the court had taken up the polarizing question of racial preferences in admissions. People eager to get courtroom seats lined up hours before the cases were heard, and a crowd estimated by police at between 5,000 and 7,000 people gathered outside and on the nearby Mall. Three white applicants rejected by the University of Michigan and its law school are challenging the school's admissions policies as unconstitutional racial discrimination. They contend that black, Hispanic and American Indian candidates with the same qualifications are given preferential treatment. "I have to say that in looking at your program it looks to me like this is just a disguised quota,"Justice Anthony M. Kennedy-told a university lawyer. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who with Kennedy is considered a crucial swing vote on the issue, .asked skeptical questions of the white applicants' lawyer. "You say [race] can't be. a factor at all. Is that it -is that your position, that it cannot be one of many factors?" O'Connor asked lawyer Kirk Kolbo. Told yes, O'Connor replied that the constitutional argument isn't so simple. "You're speaking in absolutes and it isn't quite that," she said. "I think we have given recognition to the use of race in a variety of settings." The court amassed more than 100 friend-of-the-court filings on the affirmative action cases, an apparent record. Most of the filings backed the idea that affirmative action has a place in American life, from the classroom to the boardroom. The race issue is awkward for the Bush administration, whose most conservative supporters hope the cases will spell the end of all preferences or set-asides for minorities. Bush has not gone that far, pointing instead to what he calls racially neutral ways to achieve campus diversity. The Michigan undergraduate school uses a point system to, screen the thousands of applicants it receives each year. A minority member can get a 20-point bonus out of the system's possible 150, while various measures of academic performance, extracurricular activity and other attributes are generally worth less. The law school uses a vaguer system intended to yield a "critical mass" of minorities in each class. The resulting mix of students from different racial, ethnic, geographical and economic.backgrounds benefits eveIyo, icluding whites, lawyer Maureen, Mahoney argued. "Sure, they're in already," Justice Antonin Scalia exclaimed. "The people you want to talk to are the high school seniors who have seen people visibly less qualified than they are get into prestigious institutions where they are rejected. If you think that is not creating resentment, you are just wrong." Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's only black member, broke his customary silence during oral arguments to question the premise that race-conscious admissions policies furthered a broader social goal of racial understanding and harmony.

14 ,ALUGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2,2003 p MVERS T*R pr 2 SCHOOL RSHPS/p Teresa Porterwins Truman Scholarship The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation selected University of Florida junior Teresa Porter as a winner of the group's national scholarship for students preparing for leadership in public service. The award consists of a $27,000 scholarship for graduate school and a $3,000 scholarship for the senior year. Porter, from St. Augustine, is doublemajoring in political science and sociology. She is the president of Panhellenic Council and a member of Phi Mu fraternity for women at UF, and is the Florida state coordinator of the Southeastern Panhellenic Conference. Porter studied overseas at the University of Cambridge through a UF study abroad program, and she teaches dance at the intermediate and advanced levels at a local .dance studio. In a policy proposal she was required to write as part of the application, Porter proposed to increase funding to communities supporting programs that follow children .through each stage of development to prevent truancy. Last semester, Porter completed an internship with the Alachua County State Attorney's Office Project Payback program, which seeks to assist juvenile offenders in paying restitution. Truman Scholars are selected for their extensive records of public and community service, their commitment to careers in government or elsewhere in public service, and their outstanding leadership potential and communication skills. The foundation requires students to be nominated by their institutions, and selected 76 winners nationally from 63 colleges and universities. The winners were selected from among 635 candidates nominated by 305 colleges and universities. Nationally, 212 finalists were selected from 144 institutions for regional interviews, and six students represented Florida as finalists. Porter was the only winner selected from the state. The 2003 Truman Scholars will assemble May 18 for a weeklong leadership development program at William Jewell College in Liberty, Mo., and receive their awards in a special ceremony at the Truman Library in Independence, Mo., on May 25.

The countdown is to April 7, when a group of 19 individuals lead by Dr. Michael Adams, President of the University of Georgia, will be on campus to assess how well we have illustrated the success of our and operational processes. Five days, 8 hours, minutes and seconds remain on the countdown clock that sits on the corner of Dr. Jill Varnes' desk in Tigert Hall. For the past two years Varnes along with a number of other faculty, staff Colleges and Schools, Centers and Institutes and other campus organizations for a number of reasons. President Charles Young identified internationalization as a critical element in the university's strategic plan. Provost David Colburn has noted that as a state institution we must recognize the value to Florida in preparing more internationally astute graduates. Florida is one of te 10 major immigrantreceiving states in the United States and is heavily engaged in the international economy.

Undergraduates -11 a.m. Tuesday, Reitz Union, Room 284. educational programs SACS-COC reaffirms accreditation every 10 years; the University of Florida has maintained continuous accreditation since 1913. For this accreditation cycle, the university has gone beyond the traditional selfstudy and focused on the area of internationalization. The Global UF initiative became a focal point for the self-studies completed by the needs of UF students. One job in five in the United States today is dependent on the international economy. If our students are going to be competitive, the university must ensure they have a global perspective. We believe we have done the work necessary to receive reaffirmation of accreditation, but the real value of this process has been in creating a vision for the university as a truly international community. Through the strategic focus on internationalization, we have had the opportunity to involve a wide range of individuals from across campus. The willingness of individuals across campus to be involved in this process has been remarkable. The complete report submitted to SACS-COC is posted on the Global UF Web site at www.global.ufl.edu. Faculty, students and staff are encouraged to visit the site to learn more about international activities at UF. Sustainability workshops begin this month In an effort to advance University of Florida President Charles Young's goal of making the University of Florida a global leader in sustainability, a series of workshops will begin in April.

IT, ALLIGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2003 Former Republican director admits to wire interception The Associated Press RICHMOND, Va. -Edmund A. Matricardi III, former executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of felony wire intercept for listening in on a Democratic Party conference call, the U.S. attorney's office said. Under terms of a plea agreement, federal prosecutors will recommend that Matricardi serve three years of probation and pay a $10,000 fine. ."o!'This recommendation permits Mr. Matricardi to provide for his wife and two little girls and further continue his appeal that his conduct did not amount to wiretapping," said his attorney, Steven D. Benjamin. Matricardi-had been charged with two counts of unlawful interception of a wire communication, two counts of unlawful disclosure of intercepted wire communications and one count of aiding and abetting the interception of a wire communication. Each of the five counts carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. "Mr. Matricardi never denied that he listened to the call," Benjamin said. "If this case had gone to trial and he had been convicted, the minimum mandatory sentence could have been 18 months in prison." Matricardi, executive director of the state GOP from 1999 until April 2002, was accused of using an access code he had been given by a former Democratic Party staffer to join an interstate conference call on March 22, 2002. Prosecutors accused Matricardi of secretly listening for about 2 1/2 hours and tape-recording the call as Democratic legislators, party leaders and their lawyers discussed strategy in a court battle over legislative redistricting. Matricardi, 34, was indicted by a Richmond Circuit Court grand jury on felony wiretapping charges last April 9. The state charges were later dropped and the case was turned over to federal authorities. Matricardi took a job with South Carolina Republican Party but resigned from that position in January after he was indicted by the federal grand jury. He pleaded innocent Feb. 12, claiming the conference calls qualified as "open meetings" under Virginia laws. Plane hij acker surrenders The Associated Press KEY WEST' In the second hijacking of a Cuban plane in as many weeks, a hijacker claiming to have two grenades surrendered an hour after forcing the aircraft to land in Florida with 32 people aboard. The hijacker was carrying a little boy when he came off the Cuban Airlines plane at the Key West airport and was wearing a red windbreaker with the word "America" stitched in white on the back. He was taken into FBI custody. "He got off the plane with a child in his arms," said Key West Police spokesmap Steve Torrence. When he put the child down, "the little child grabbed his leg," he added. The surrender ended a more than 12-hour ordeal spent largely at the Havana airport, where he demanded that the plane be refueled so it could reach Key West. He had insisted on continuing despite a U.S. official's warning that he would be prosecuted and denied asylum. The man was identified as Adermis Wilson Gonzalez, age 33 or 34, U.S. Attorney Marcos Jimenez said. Gonzalez was traveling with his wife and 3-year-old son, he said. FBI agent Hector Pesquera said no charges had been filed. Translators planned to interview the 24 other passengers -10 men, nine women and four children -and seven crew members. Authorities found two fake grenades after using a bomb-sniffing dog to search the aircraft, Monroe County Sheriff Richard Roth said. A search of Gonzalez's homein Cuba turned up four homemade grenades that had not been armed with explosives, according to a statement read on Cuban state television. The communique also said Gonzalez had been living on the small Isle of Youth, southwest of Cuba's main island. It was unclear how someone could have gotten the purported grenades through heavy security checks at Cuba's airports, especially less than two weeks after a successful hijacking. Passengers left the plane not far from the parked Douglas DC-3 that was hijacked on March 19. Both hijackings took place on Cuban domestic flights from the Isle of Youth to the capital of Havana.

WEDNESDAY, i Son oIf-evangelist-causescontroversy with The Associated Press CHARLOTE, N.C. -Franklin Graham; who enraged many Muslims when he called Islam an "evil and wicked" religion, is stirring more controversy with a plan to send relief workers into Iraq in the Name of Jesus Christ" when the war ends. Samaritan's Purse, the Boone-based relief agency headed by Graham, is poised td provide shelter, water and medical assistance inside Iraq as soon as the military clearance is available. Workers can provide drinking water for up to 20,000 people, materials to build temporary shelters for more than 4,000 families, and household items and medical kits to meet the needs of up to 100,000 people for three months, Graham has said. Some Muslim groups believe Graham has ulterior motives. "Given his past viewpoints, people are suspicious about his real aim, which could be to take advantage of a situation in which people are desperate," said Hodan Hassan, a spokeswoman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington, D.C. "They will have food in one hand and the Bible in the other." A spokesman for Graham said Tuesday that he will respond to the concerns in an op-ed piece expected to appear Wednesday in the Los Angeles Times. Hassan said Graham, son of famed evangelist Billy Graham, is familiar to the Iraqi people. "The world is getting smaller and smaller every day," she said last week. "His comments about Islam being a wicked and evil religion were broadcast around the world. With that in mind, people will be worried about presence of his organization in Iraq." Graham has never recanted his statements regarding Islam, which put a lot of American Muslims in danger," Hassan said. Graham's post-Sept. 11, 2001 comments on Islam rfiade him a controversial figure at home and abroad. In a TV interview, he called Islam "a very evil and wicked religion." In a subsequent radio interview, Graham criticized Muslim clerics for not apologizing for the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Samaritan's Purse, which Graham founded a quarter-century ago, has conducted Christian relief and aid missions in more than 100 countries and has an annual budget of more than $150 million. Samaritan's Purse has worked closely with Christians in Iraq since 1991, said Graham, who first visited Baghdad 30 years ago. A Temple University professor of Islamic studies said he believes that, in this case, Graham should raise money for a nonreligious aid group such as the Red Cross rather than provide aid through Samaritan's Purse. "This is kind of condescending and foolish, to call the religion of some people wicked and then go to help them," professor He argued that any attei*t1 evangelize Islamic Iraqis is likely to be unsuccessful. "Mr. Graham thinks he wants to go and convert the Muslims. But historically, the Muslims have not been easily convertible," he said. Graham has said Samaritan's Purse has been invited by Christians in Iraq to perform relief work. "As Christians, we love the Iraqi people, and we are poised and ready to help meet ther needs," he said in a statement announcing the Iraq initiative. "Our prayers are with the innocent families of Iraq, just as they are with our brave soldiers and leaders."

 .... .. IW, ALLIGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL.-2, 2003 Israel says peace plan should be re-thought The Associated Press JERUSALEM -Israel's foreign minister said Tuesday the United States is determined to publish a )ideast peace plan soon but Israel would seek changes before accepting it. The Israeli opposition leader, Amram Mitzna, and Palestinian officials said Israel effectively is rejecting the plan, a three-stage .road map" to Palestinian statehood by 2005. The Americans are "determined to publish the road map," the foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, told Israel Army Radio on Tuesday, a day after meeting with President Bush at the White House. Shalom laid down a number of conditions for resuming talks with the Palestinians and said "the road map needs to be adapted." Israel repeatedly has said it accepts the "Bush vision," which is based on a policy speech he delivffed June 24, but has balked at embracing the road map drawn up by the "Quartet" -the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -outlining implementation of that vision. A diplomatic source said on condition of anonymity that Quartet officials would meet in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday to discuss the possible publication of the road map and how to monitor compliance by both sides. The source said the monitoring mechanism was expected to be a point of contention. "We expect that after the road map is published the first things they [the Palestinians] must do is halt the terror and the incitement," Shalom said. If the conditions are met, Israel would be a "true partner, exploring all roads to peace." The United States and Britain have said the road map would be unveiled after the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Cabinet are sworn in, probably sometime this month. ., Palestinian leaders met with U.S. representatives Tuesday and were told by acting U.S. consul Jeff Feldman that the United States would set up a ",monitoring mechanism" to make sure the road map was implemented when the Palestinian government started functioning, said Nabil Shaath, Palestinian planning minister. The United States also would push for a roadmap.,s Ao a, -raft presented a yr wth nd es m wa no irae te conWe designed our corporate ladder to make it easier to succeed.

ALLIGATOR, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2003 Gators get break from SEC schedule, fce FAMU By Brian Shaffer Alligator Writer The UF baseball team has made it a goal to prove the doubters wrong this season, and to this point, the Gators have. However, before the team attempts to quiet the experts wb are quick to point out the Ga ors have yet to win a road ga ie, the team must focus on to: ight's opponent, Florida A& M. -F (22-6-1, 5-3-1 Southeastpor Conference) will play host to the Rattlers tonight at McKethan Stadium with the first pitch scheduled for 6:30. Looking to add to their current five-game winning streak, the Gators know they can not overlook FAMU in a haste to get back into SEC play. "Our ultimate goal [for the mid-week games] is to win every one," first baseman C.J. Smith said. "But we want to keep in tune and keep getting our at-bats. If we just played the weekend series and not play anything in between, it would be hard." Getting tie team to switch its focus after having experienced DAVID ZENTZ I ALLIGATOR STAFF First baseman C.J. Smith slides into the power-hitter role after the absence of last year's first baseman, Ryan Shealy. Smith leads the Gators with nine home runs. recent conference success is the task Coach Pat McMahon and his staff are concentrating on. "Once you start conference play, and play in the middle of the week, one has to be able to mind-shift back to nonconference games," he said. "Because every game is as important at the end'as it is when we start the season." The coaches will be watching for continued improvement by the team in-every area of play -pitching, offense and defense -as well as monitoring how the team reacts to the environment of a nonconference game, McMahon said. Offensive improvement this season has come from, among many newcomers, the sophomore Smith, who is second on the team in batting average at .380 and is the team leader in slugging percentage at .740. The past two seasons have been rough for Smith, waiting his turn behind former Gator Ryan Shealy. But after Shealy moved on, Smith's patience has paid off with a starting spot at first base, and the Tampa native has responded with solid production. While critics had UF pegged for a mediocre year, Smith and his teammates knew the kind of ball club they would put on the field in 2003. "That's how it always is," Smith said. "People are going to say that you don't have the pitching staff, or whatever. "But, we knew what we had. We have a very good team and we're coming through." After a three-game sweep of Tennessee over the weekend, UF sits at the top of the SEC Eastern Division. And with a road series upcoming against Vanderbilt, the Gators will look to allow those players who saw limited action against the Volunteers a chance to play tonight, McMahon said. One of those players is pitcher Darren O'Day. The sophomore missed playing time during the weekend STEPHEN BAMONTE / ALLIGATOR while he suffered through a sickness. When asked if there is a possibility that O'Day could see some action against FAMU, McMahon said there was "no question." "Just before the ball game [against Tennessee], we found out he was sick... and we had to readjust our plans," McMahon said. "But that gave the opportunity for other guys to step forward -Tom Potter, Bryan Ball and Connor Falkenbach stepped forward." Doubleheader with Bulls rejuvenates in-state rivalry By Daniel Shanks Alligator Writer In-state rivals clash today as the UF softball team faces South Florida in a doubleheader in Tampa. The No. 24 Gators (27-10, 10-2 Southeastern Conference), faced No. 22 USF earlier in the season in the GRU Classic on Feb. 7. The Bulls gave UF all they could handle, but freshman Lindsey Cameron's heroics in the bottom of the seventh inning gave the Gators a 4-3 victory. "We pretty much know what to expect," said UF coach Karen Johns about the Gators' second meeting with the Bulls. "Obviously, they have a great pitching staff. They're throwing the ball really well, and they have great team speed, so defense is going to have to be on their *&~es.The defense, which had been a point of concern forJohns earlier in the season, has shown signs of improvement. "I think they've learned to relax a little bit better, have a little more confidence in what they're doing, ad I think they're just maturing" Johns said. The two teams were scheduled to meet An the kanship .game of the GRU .riaosko,outthelonts was canceled be-, Wof rain. an extra incentive to take the doubleheader. "It makes us a little more pumped up to go out there and kick their butt," senior Prissie Walden said. The doubleheader falls in the middle of the Gators' SEC schedule. After the two teams meet, the Gators go on to face Georgia and Alabama, who are both on top of their respective divisions. Despite interrupting the Gators' charge toward an SEC title, Johns said she welcomes the change of pace. "I think it's good for us," Johns said. "[USF] probably feel the same way. "They have a tough schedule in Conference USA coming up, and I think being able to play midweek like this against a good opponent keeps us fresh, keeps us on our-toes and ready to go." She said she also isn't worried about the team looking ahead to the remaining SEC schedule because many of the players have played with or against one another before, The big in-state rivalry plays a factor as well, she said. Since.the two toughest ieams in the SEC are coming up soo Walden said ,its crucial to play, welin hi doubleheader. iS, Very import becafet ur~~ carries 6merkdhigattugb~W de SFCC pitcher fills empty spot By Louis Anastasis Alligator Contributing Writer During an injury that was supposed to mar SFCC's softball season, Erin Guerra has stepped up to shoulder the Saints' (28-11-1, 12-5 Mid-Florida Conference) pitching load. Sophomore pitchers Laurie Lopez and Karenmarie Pena began the season as SFCC's two pitchers and had combined records of 15-2 through March 13. m Then, Pena went down with a lower back strain, and Coach Chris Ahern turned to Guerra. Since the injury, Gue~rra 1 has gone 5-3 and has helped Lopez move the SPORTS Saints in the right direction. Before winning in her first two starts of the season, Guerra had no collegiate experience as a pitcher. One of only five SFCC players from out of state, Guerra also has been a solid outfielder and productive hitter. Winning four of their previoussix games, the Saints split a doubleheader agant Lake Citykomuity C college on Tuesday. The game saw the et of Pena (9-4) as she appeatedan thenmbud for the first tkie inceher i.ury. On Friday, SFCC hosted Georgia Perimeter College and split a doubheader. 1h:n lrts nwere-nt very the' &alrgsilatthrown m-bu to edge the Jaguars 1-0. In game two, Georgia Perimeter outpitched SFCC for the 3-1 victory. SFCC traveled north to play South Georgia College in another doubleheader Saturday. Stellar pitching performances by Lopez and Guerra resulted in two SFCC victories. The first game was a 3-0 victory for the Saints. Lopez (13-4) threw a no-hitter while also hitting an RBI double from the plate. In the second game, Guerra matched Lopez with a no-hitter of her own. Eight of nine SFCC players scored in the second game while Renee Francis collected two RBI and two runs scored. Stacie Pestrak was a combined 5-7 with two triples on the day. Pestrak is hitting over .400 for the season. NO BASEBALL, JUST RAIN: The SFCC baseball team has been dealing with it all year, and this past week was no exception.

JEREMY FOWLER FOWL LANGUAGE Baseball reigns during sluggish sports season As I strolled to class Tuesday, a lady approached me with a microphone by the O'Connell Center. My first instinct was she thought I resembled -let me think about this one -maybe Kyle, fronVthe movie "Road Trip?" How about Andrii Kirilenko of the Utah Jazz? Ingle Martin? I'm guessing it wasn't Ben Affleck, but that's not why she wanted to speak with me. I just happened to be the next affable student walking around when the Channel 5 TV station was attempting to do an April Fools spoof about the UF men's basketball team. Pretty much, they asked me to pretend the Gators hoopsters were going to the Final Four in front of the camera. .Man, that really would have fooled the world. Come on, Channel 5. The people in Slovenia know about UF's dismantling on national TV against Michigan State. After I respectfully declined and headed to class, however, it suddenly hit me why the broadcasters were lost like Ron Artest without a video camera. They simply felt they had no other UF sports to cover. They wanted to relive the glory days of the Gators hoopsters a month ago, when UF's chances for NCAA supremacy were still fresh. I then proceeded t8think about the days of early April, which can feel more like an Alaskan winter when it comes to the big-name UF sports. Spring football doesn't always make me want to do the Harlem shake. I'd rather eat glass sometimes tlian hear about the quarterback controversy, how well Gavin Dickey threw his screens or how many ounces of Gatorade Patrick Dosh drank after practice. It's just spring practice, and nothing is relevant until the fall. So UF needs a fearless leader right now in sports. It's got to be a sport that can ease the mind from the war with Iraq. We all can only take so much of Dan Rather's buzz cut and the 24-hour coverage. It took me sometime to figure it out, but I had the solution by the time I plopped Sdo wn in my class seat -UF baseball's got to do it. I knew it had to be One of the three big sports, and basketball and football just won't cut it right now. -I know what you're thinking: YoU'd probably rather listen to -Tom Brokaw speak about the war than watch Tom PotBut thsi the perfect situation for UF to appca coloru team. Th Gators are; public relations diecor .an4 oumer BeaHaraz ppaao th aieo S W AL ATO3' 3WEDES AAPI2,03 1 Sprain temporarily sidelines tailback By Jill Marlin Alligator Staff Writer jmartin@alligator.org Most likely, critics are pinning Ran Carthon as UF's starting tailback. But after a minor injury, Carthon temporarily will move-down on the depth chart for the next few days. Carthon, a senior, is expected to sit out for the week after suffering a foot injury Saturday. He did not dress for Tuesday's practice, and he was on the sideline with crutches while wearing a protective boot on his left leg. However, the injury is not serious, Carthon and Coach Ron Zook both said Tuesday. "I think it's just a sprained foot," Zook said. "They did a bone scan, and there's not any problem there." Carthon said at the end of practice Tuesday that someone landed on his foot when he was running with the ball at Saturday's scrimmage. Carthon said he hopes to practice in the next few days. Cornerback Deshawn Carter has not been cleared to fully participate in practices because of a breathing problem he has had for the last two weeks. Carter, a sophomore, was held out of Saturday's scrimmage. Zook said he does not have all of the information on Carter's diagnosis. "I don't know. [The doctors] haven't called back," Zook said. "They can't release everything. He has to sign a release and do all that stuff for the doctors to tell us. I don't think it's going to be a problem." Zook said Carter can participate in what he called "mild activity." "I don't foresee it being a major problem," Zook said. After suffering a possible concussion at Saturday's scrimmage, sophomore quarterback Ingle Martin participated Tuesday with Patrick Dosh and Gavin Dickey. LINEBACKER SHIFT CONTINUES: Although Taurean Charles is back from his two-week suspension, he may not return to middle linebacker. When Charles was suspended at the bN ginning of spring practice, UF moved junior Todd McCullough to the middle. McCullough started four games last season and has the most experience of the group competing for starting roles. "He's played outside. Now he's played inside and doing everything the way we're doing with techniques and so forth," Zook said. "Playing two spots gives you depth." Although Zook has not said why he suspended Charles, the redshirt freshman is back in the Coach's favor after missing the first half of spring practice. "He's done the things he's supposed to do to get back out there," Zook said. Gymnastics uses SEC experience as lesson By Brian Shaffer Alligator Writer The UF gymnastics team's trip to Birmingham, Ala., can be summed up as unfulfilled expectations. While the Gators placed third for the third cohsecutive year at the Southeastern Conference Championship, this was the year they were supposed to take the next step. "Sometimes, as a program or a team, the SEC Championship is more difficult mentally and physically than a national championship itself," Coach Rhonda Faehn said. "It is a high pressure situation with a lot going on. So, for us, it is great that we experienced that and got through it and are learning from it." UF is looking at what happened at-the SEC Championship in two ways -as a lesson learned and as motivation. "With each meet, we gain experience and we have a couple of new girls out there, and it was their first SECs, their first big postseason meet, and now they know what it's like," senior Jenny Carow said. "So, maybe now it won't be so intimidating for them." Carow mentioned the UF upperclassman have helped the first-year gyamnasts to remain calm in order to fight off being overwhelmed in their first opportunity to compete in the high-pressure atmosphere of a collegiate postseason. Although her team was sent reeling from Birmingham, Faehn said she knows the two weeks off from the SEC Champi6nship to NCAA Regional competition will help mend those wounds and allow them to refocus. "Our goal is to fix the mistakes that happened at 'ECs ad bit our routines [at Region s," said Faehn about h e teams current mludset, stsar on floor:hitting al six routines and then move on to vault and be extremely consistent and compete aggressively and confidently." BOUNCING BACK ON BARS: After spending several weeks as the nation's top team on uneven bars and holding the No. 4 spot in the bars rankings going into the SEC Championships, the Gators posted their lowest score of the year at an inopportune time. "I know that their confidence has definitely not taken a hit," said Faehn after talking the performance over with the bars lineup. "I think [their reaction] was more of just shock. Most teams have had to struggle with something like that happening throughout the season, and I think our bars team was spoiled in that it hasn't happened to them this season." While Faehn said it was too early to tell if she would tweak the lineup that competed at the SEC Championship for Regional competition, one addition is possible. This addition might be thO return of freshman Sherie Owens, who is set to return in the near future after suffering from a dislocated knee. "We still have another week and a half of training, and we're really going to have to see wbt, transpires thattimFaeh-a sid,-:"Wel see ifShei'saeAoget-back in there on her lend ig d to see h6w eeyone else_ rdoes.
