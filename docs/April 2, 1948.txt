The outcome of the election, although announced on page one, is not known as these words are slapped down on paper. And yet we want to nay these vords as if the election is already over and the candidates are selected and the weeks of political entanglements have come to an end. By the time the paper is read, 'e hope everyone has eliminated all such political nonsense and has started thinking about the road ahead, on +he problemss these newly-elected officers will be facing. No, we are not addressing ths to the owners alone, for you-s students-hae the voice in the government. We are proposingwe are writing this on the "crying need for oiy" after elections, The essence of the whole problem of the future of this University lies in understanding how to put first things first. In order to list those first, and accomplish them, we must have unity in our student government. That unity cannot be based on everybody being in continual agreement with each detail of student government and its policy, but should be based upon discipline and good will. We urge all of you to accept errors in policy, as inevitable, and we urge you to look at the overall picture rather than the insignificant details. Whe Sthe gesisiene attid ItoSu Wedesday night in political rafles, crying to the top of the iefe sorIndependent men to believe that each porty was putting for them, an important meeting of the new Independent organization was going on in Florida Union. It seems that If the new party and the remaoinng parties were really interested In putting permanent good Into effect, they would have sont their independent leaders to help such a cause. What we w=S to know: B politics only trying to get m n into office rather than getting sm into office to aromplish something? The business of the newly-elected officers in the greatest period in the University's history is to look for agreement, eschew partisanship, and try for compromise in every single situation that will confront them. We will dare say that most of the fights between the parties has been more to get their men into office than their knowing What theyare getting them into office for. 'ye will not condemn anyone for wanting to get into office. But we would like to mention that the political groups on his campus work more to get control of the students than to gain office and be leaders of the controlling students. Let's remember the old, well-knwn statement that all association-including student government-are formed for the attainment ,of some good. Let us try to build in our lives that "something" which will help this campus to grow, to help the world in general. Life, it seems, is forgetting and remembering. We best remember the past when we try to remedy the wrongs. Election is over. Let us seek to overthrow any undemocratic methods of government. We, the Alligator, seek and rejoice at agreement; we will fight against and never rejoice at rifts. The Thomas Hotel Club Gainesville, Florida Open Monday Through Saturday 5 P.M.

This evasion of theatre talk is not necessaril desired hythe producers -it in only theatre talk with sonworking actors that bothers them. The theory that they become producers only so they will be able to go to bars, talk theatre and meet stars, backers and other producers in Sardis or the Algonquin holds water however, as they, martinis. There is one service in New York that is unparalleled forsmaking contacts. It is called Lexington Exchange (LE 2-1100) andfor a nominal fee it proposes to take telephone messages for actors and relay them. The system, which presents innumerable chances for error, evolves three phone calls: one from the message giver, one from the subscriber, and one to the message giver from the subscriber. It's easier to drop in Sardi's or the Algonquin.
