By Sara MarinoAlligator Contributing WriterA UF team competed nationally and won the people’s choice award for its gun-safety device Thursday night. Three UF students and one student from the Georgia Institute of Technology competed in the innovation category at Microsoft’s 2016 U.S. Imagine Cup competition in San Francisco. Their design, Gun Loc, can be the size of a Cheez-It and sticks to a gun. It allows the gun’s owner to track its location and know The four came up with the idea while traveling to the University of Illinois’ hack-athon, HackIllinois, in February. The team made a software program within 36 hours, said Bernard Marger, a UF computer engineering senior. During the competition, the team created the app to track a gun and won third place overall, the 21-yearold said. The team’s device measures the vibrations and movement made when a gun is picked up, he said. Microsoft’s category for using Azure, a Microsoft online cloud computer storage and backup program, said Jean-Ralph Aviles, a UF computer engineering senior. A few weeks after HackIllinois, the team’s members got an email from Microsoft urging them to apply to the company’s 2016 U.S. Imagine Cup competition, the 22-year-old said. “We weren’t expecting much, but we got the email from the Microsoft recruiter and entered our product in,” he said, “Now we’re in San Francisco.” Marger said his team created Gun Loc to let gun owners know where their guns are at all times. “Basically, this is bringing us said. has made it to the national competition, he said. This team was also the only one at the competition to have a member from another school. Faizan Virani, a Georgia Tech computer science sophomore, decided to join Marger’s team during the 18-hour trip to Illinois. “It’s amazing that by meeting (Marger) in one hack-athon led to this,” the 19-year-old said. Troy Gittelmacher, a UF computer engineering senior, said the experience has been surreal. “Making a project in 36 hours at a hack-athon has turned into this,” the 21-year-old said. “It’s been an eye-opening experience on how the demand for new ideas is growing.” Marger said a Gainesville gun distributor has contacted the team’s members about selling the software, but they haven’t decided yet whether they want to sell it. “I was not expecting that, but that is a wide-open door if we want to do that,” he said.

On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill that acknowledges the abuse and deaths of boys at the North Florida reform school in Marianna, Florida. Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, introduced Senate Bill 708 in November. On March 15, it was presented to Scott, who signed it 15 days later. The bill sets aside a total of $500,000 for families to properly dren. Each family will receive up to $7,500 for burial and funeral arrangements. Bryant Middleton, 70, a Gainesville resident and former Dozier student, said the bill proves the horrors of the abuse he and former students suffered. taining full justice across the board for every child that was beaten and brutalized,” Middleton said. The Florida Legislature can decide to repeal the legislation, UF professor Darren Hutchinson wrote in an email, but he doesn’t believe they will. Hutchinson said the bill doesn’t mean Florida admits any wrongdoing, nor does it require students’ families to receive compensation for alleged grievances. “Unexplained and suspicious deaths, incidents of sexual assault, and mass incarceration are ongoing problems that Floridians need to address and solve,” Hutchinson said. @MelissaGomez004 mgomez@alligator.orgGov.

4 ALLIGATOR FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2016By Brittany SpinoAlligator Contributing WriterStudents said they felt mixed emotions after the Snapchat app announced efforts to improve communication Tuesday. Chat 2.0 incorporated new features that mimic “face-to-face conversation,” allowing users to switch between video chatting, texting and calling, the company announced. Monica Huynh, a 19-year-old UF biology sophomore, said the updates can be overwhelming. “Sometimes I think it’s best to keep things simple,” she said. “I liked Snapchat because it didn’t have the millions of features that other messaging apps have; now it’s kind of annoying.” Snapchat also introduced Auto-Advance Stories, changing the way users view a 24-hour feed of photographs and videos posted by fellow users. Stories now transition seamlessly from one user to the next, whereas Snapchatters previously had to click individual friends to view their stories. Along with the free features, Snapchat now charges users for the ability to replay a Snap. As of press time, Snapchatters can purchase three Replays for 99 cents, 10 Replays for $2.99, and 20 replays for $4.99. Endy Morales, a 21-year-old UF criminology senior, said he enjoys the more than 200 stickers — including walruses, sloths, aliens and Snapchat’s signature ghost — included in the updates. “I love the new sloth emojis,” Morales said. “But I wish there was a way to turn off autoplay; I liked choosing whose stories I watched.”THE THREE NEW BOARD MEMBERS WILL BE APPOINTED IN JUNE. Alligator Staff WriterUF’s Board of Trustees will have three new members in June. UF announced Thursday that Gov. Rick Scott appointed Morteza Hosseini, a land developer, to succeed Christopher Corr. The Florida Board of Governors also appointed Marsha Powers and Leonard Johnson to UF’s 13-member board. The new members will serve until 2019, wrote UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes in an email. Board of Trustees members are not paid for their service. Members are staggered with fiveyear terms, she said. Powers, the chief executive officer of Tenet Healthcare’s Florida Region, will succeed Charles Edwards. Johnson, a Tampa Bay-area attorney, will replace Susan Cameron. Both Powers and Johnson attended UF. “The individuals who serve on the board come from a variety of backgrounds and professions and each brings a unique set of skills and experiences to the table,” Sikes said. Susan Webster, a UF international studies senior and Student Body president-elect, will replace current Student Body President Joselin Padron-Rasines on the board. Webster said she looks forward to discussing education policies on the board next term. “I think that every member has a passion for not only the University of Florida, but also for making UF a top-10 university,” the 22-year old said. @merylkornfield mkornfield@alligator.orgAlligator Contributing WriterA mile of University Avenue will close Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. as thousands of residents visit the fourth-annual Active Streets Gainesville. Organizers expect up to 10,000 visitors throughout the event, which includes interactive booths from local businesses and organizations, said Kathryn Horter, a Gainesville Street Alliance committee member. The mile between West Sixth Street and Northeast Boulevard will be closed, according to an event “It is free for vendors to sign up, and they are expected to provide free, fun activities,” Horter said. Joseph Floyd, the executive director of the Active Streets Alliance, originally requested funding from the Florida Department of Transportation to bring the “ciclovias” to life. “These ciclovias include a closing of a public pathway of certain streets, a practice sometimes called ‘open streets,’” he said. Floyd said Active Streets Gainesville is the only Florida ciclovia organized solely by citizens and funded by the FDOT and the city — all while attracting more visitors. This year, organizers added a bike valet, where guests can park their ride while visiting the main event or a concert taking place on Bo Diddley Plaza afterward. Horter said the free event brings together locals who may never meet in everyday circumstances. “The event is designed to highlight and build community,” she said. “There is no headliner or main event because we all meet in the street as equals.”Isabel Bonnet / Alligator StaffHENNA HANDSEmana Sheikh, a 21-year-old UF nutritional sciences senior who is part of the Arabic Student Association, paints a henna tattoo on Merikris Boado, a 22-year-old UF family youth and community sciences senior on the Plaza of the Americas as part of the Art Extravaganza event on Thursday.

From Bossy to Boss Women’s Leadership Conference will start Saturday at 9:30 a.m. at Pugh Hall. Members of Women’s Mentorship and Advocacy Program wanted to inspire women of all backgrounds to be confident in who they are. The conference will allow UF students to network and understand their strengths, Caitlin Bletscher, a co-coordinator of the event, said. The theme shows how women can be assertive without being overbearing. After three keynote speakers talk about empowering others, networking and leadership skills, participants will discuss the talks, the UF agricultural education and communication doctoral student said. Bletscher, 29, got the idea for the conference during the summer, she said. At the conference, she said she wants participants to collaborate with each other. Men are also welcome to attend. Corina McBride, a UF natural resource conservation sophomore, said she helped plan the conference and will attend this weekend. “I’d love to leave with a sense of empowerment, whether it be through myself or through others,” the 19-year-old said. She said she hopes to make other attendees feel strong and confident when they enter the workplace. “I’m really excited to reach out to the local community and connect with girls and give them an insight in how successful their future can be,” McBride said. Bossy to Boss: encouraging By Andrea BenaimAlligator Contributing WriterUF dancers are collecting canned food to help families with sick children. Extreme Dance Company will have collection boxes in the lobby of the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts at its semesterly Spring showcase, We Run The World, on Sunday. The nonperishable food will go to Ronald McDonald House Charities of North Central Florida, Rachel Keyt, a company costume chair, said. Members of the company decided to collect food in place of charging admission to give back to the community, the UF animal sciences sophomore said. The group picked Ronald McDonald House because it is partnered with UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, she said. Ronald McDonald House helps families stay together while their children are in the hospital. The group doesn’t have a goal to reach, Keyt, 19, said. They want to help as many as they can. “It’s a simple thing, but it can have a really big impact,” she said. This semester’s show is based off Beyonc’s song “Run the World,” which promotes feminine power, Keyt said. All of the songs in the show are sung by artists who are women. Drew Chodash, a UF marketing freshman, said she’s glad to help the Gainesville community through dance. She said she hopes students come out and donate. “I think donating cans to the Ronald McDonald House is a really great idea to give back to the community in a fun way — by donating a can instead of paying an entry fee to the show,” 19-year-old said. THERE IS A CHILI COOK-OFF AND A SPRINGS CELEBRATION. By Lauren JohnsonAlligator Contributing WriterAlachua County will celebrate nature with pots of chili and a roster of activities Saturday. The annual O’Leno Ole’ Chili Cook-Off is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at O’Leno State Park, located at 410 SE O’Leno Park Road in High Springs, Florida. A Springs Celebration is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the same location, and admission to both events is free with the donation of a canned food item. “It is a celebration to get people out in nature,” said Stacie Greco, the water conservation coordinator for the Alachua County Environmental Protection Department. About 30 people usually sign up to compete in the cookoff, and guests can sample the entries with a $5 tasting kit, said Harriet Walsh, the event coordinator. “These people get kind of crazy sometimes,” she said. “They will dress up or decorate their canopy.” Greco said the band Weeds of Eden will perform a variety of musical genres, and local artists will display their work. She said visitors often enjoy the Springs Water Challenge, which shows participants how much water they use on a daily basis. Unlike last year, Greco said, the Water Ventures interactive display won’t be present.

The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the Alligator.Editorial Column A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, or so it seems, we students returned from Spring Break and told ourselves “we have plenty of time” until the end of the semester. Oh, where does the time go? We’re now on a countdown to the last day of classes, April 20, with only two and a half weeks left till liftoff. And as the tidal wave of deadlines and all-nighters rapidly approaches, we extend to you our helping hand of wit, this lighthouse of cheesy, dad-approved ramblings, our latest segment ofDarts & LaurelsThursday’s editorial may have partly served as a “Marry me, I love you!” from our opinions editor to Trevor Noah (Oh, David), but one point he failed to address was how great the comedian who opened for Trevor Noah was Wednesday night. New York comedian Angelo Lozada warmed the crowd up at the Accent Speakers Bureau event by crowd-pleasing — which is generally frowned upon in comedy, but we at the Alligator feel he did so tastefully. At the very least he gave us all a cheeky perspective on the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields we often take so seriously and officially. When he called upon an audience member who was a materials science and engineering student, Lozada responded with, “Materials? Four years for that? I can do that,” looked at his onstage wooden stool and shouted, “Wood!” So we give a laurel to Angelo Lozada; thanks for the memories, sir. In other breaking news this week: “Finding Dory.” On Thursday, a list of new characters to be featured in the film was released, and it includes Dory’s parents, a collection of adorable otters and a duo of sea lions, played by none other than Dominic West and Idris Elba of HBO’s “The Wire.” Longtime fans of this hit series will now get their reunion of two of the show’s most beloved actors, and this time they’re teaming up with the rest of the “Nemo” crew. We give a laurel to the amazing cast and much-anticipated film to hit theaters June 17. However, we must also give out a preemptive dart to the army of little kids likely to storm theaters for this film. Don’t get us wrong, this splendid movie should be experienced and appreciated by all, but let there be no mistake that this movie first and foremost belongs to us: millennials, young adults, people in their 20s who refuse to grow up. It was us who endured the perilous venture and anxiety of losing, but then finally finding, Nemo back in 2003. Now, after 13 years of silently murmuring “just keep swimming” in our sleep, this movie’s ours. So to all the youngsters out there, we’ll happily share the laughter and experience of “Finding Dory” with you; just let us cut you in line. Lastly, in political news, the Arizona election fraud hearing was held Monday; the word “intense” doesn’t even come close to describing it. While Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell was apologetic at the meeting and vaguely assured further internal investigations would take place, outraged citizens called for a revote and Purcell’s resignation. We give a dart to this entire situation and trust Arizona officials will, at least, organize a revote. All votes deserve to be accurately represented: This is simply what democracy means.The most unhealthy love triangle of 2016When asked on “Meet the Press“ if he would consider being another candidate’s running mate, Ohio governor and presidential hopeful John Kasich answered, “No! Under no circumstancesYou pundits got to get out of Washington. You don’t understand me.” The purpose of Kasich’s rebuke was to make clear to voters he would not be so cynical as to compromise the integrity of his message for a comfortable position as a so-called Washington insider. He would rise above the pettiness and punditry of Washington politics, break the seven years of partisan gridlock only made worse by polarizing news media, and bring real change to a city and a nation beholden to special-interest groups as well as lobbying organizations. However, asking about Kasich’s potential to run as vice president is appropriate; the governor has no obvious path to the Republican Party nomination, except through the ambiguous mechanisms of a brokered convention. In the immediate future, Kasich’s most likely career in Washington would be under the administration of another GOP candidate. In some form or another, the notion of tackling the seemingly corrupt politics of our nation’s capital is the only bipartisan and universal message of the 2016 presidential election. Each candidate markets himself or herself as the man or woman who can properly wade through the intrinsically sinister apparatus that just happens to be the 200-year-old American democratic system. In American politics, this isn’t a new strategy. Rarely does a presidential candidate overtly promise to maintain the status quo in order to get elected. I think the last time was during the 1916 election of Woodrow Wilson. Americans adore revolutions — and at least like change — and won’t vote for a candidate who promises anything less. But what is perhaps most unusual about the current election cycle is the level of animosity between the candidates, the news media and the public. Tension between political parties has long been brewing — the inanity of the Clinton impeachment scandal may well have been the political polarization. The only possible conclusion to 24/7 cable news had to be at least a few hours of unscripted, unthoughtful semblances of dialogue. And what happens when these two trends converge? The front-runner of a major U.S. political party defends the size of his penis during a nationally televised debate. Nevertheless, this election cycle is unusual. Understandable given the trajectory of discourse, but unusual nonetheless. What has emerged is an escalating threeway ground war of mistrust among all members of the political process: the leaders, the media and the voters. More politicians and members of the press must vilify one another in order to gain credibility with the public. The public is more frequently led by the press to believe politicians are untrustworthy; the public listens. The public is more frequently told by politicians that the press is untrustworthy; the public listens. This paradox isn’t much of a problem in and of itself. Politicians can be replaced; certain members of the press do not need to be heeded. But what happens when politics and journalism itself are at fault? When the process of compromise to achieve common goals or the investigation of truth through carefully measured skepticism is in question on, frankly, both sides of the aisle? When discourse like what Americans have been seeing continues to ramify, what other conclusions are the public to draw? But my readers, to cite a particularly memorable quote from a presidential debate from Mr. Donald Trump, “I assure you, there’s no problem.” The American system of government isn’t about to tear itself apart, but it certainly seems ever more comfortable with self-cannibalism.

He witnessed it slightly in Florida’s 3-2 win over No. 12 Florida State on Tuesday, but as the Gators trudge through Southeastern Conference play, the ninth-year head coach wants his team to toughen up and show some grit. “We need to be forced into playing at a higher level mentally,” he said. A showdown with the No. 1 team in the country might do the trick. No. 2 Florida (24-3, 4-2 SEC) clashes with top-ranked Texas A&M in Gainesville a three-game set this weekend. “I wanna see how we play against one of the best teams in the country, if not the best team in the country,” O’Sullivan said. “Playing a team like A&M is going to force our dugout and our players to kind of rise to the occasion.” Texas A&M has won nine of the last 11 contests with the Gators, including two of three the last time the two teams met in TOP-RANKED TESTBy Ray BooneSports WriterEight out of 10. That’s how Florida coach J.C.

It was our worst preparation of the year When you go and play against great teams like that, you gotta be prepared, and we weren’t even close. “All of us had to pay the price I think all the guys learned a lesson.” The No. 7 Gators will have a chance to right the ship as they head to Franklin, Tennessee, to compete in the Mason Rudolph Championship on Saturday and Sunday.

FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2016 ALLIGATOR 15 preserve waterREDUCE YOUR SHOWERTIME BY 2 MINUTES UF HAS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING ITS DOUBLES PLAY. By Dylan DixonSports WriterNearly everything went right for the Florida men’s tennis team in the month of March. The No. 11 Gators (11-4, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) played some of their best tennis in years, skyrocketing up 30 spots in the national rankings. Junior Elliott Orkin won SEC Player of the Week on March 30 and Alfredo Perez garnered SEC Freshman of the Week twice on March 2 and March 23. Most importantly, Florida got off to a torrid start in conference play, going 6-1 over the course of the month to launch itself into second place in the SEC standings. With March now over, UF hopes to continue that success into April, starting tonight when the Gators take on the No. 43 Vanderbilt Commodores (12-9, 3-3 SEC) at 5 p.m. at the Ring Tennis Complex in Gainesville. “To get a streak going in the middle of Bryan Shelton said. “(But) I feel like we’ve got the right guys here that can sustain Doubles play has been a prime focus for Florida this week.

16 ALLIGATOR FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2016 By Matt BrannonSports WriterThe softball team will take on its toughest test of the season against No. 6 Alabama at 6 p.m. . The No. 1 Gators (33-1, 8-1 Southeastern Conference) and the Crimson Tide (29-6, 3-3 SEC) have won every SEC regular-season championship since 2008. “This is a phenomenal rivalry,” coach Tim Walton said. “Who wins this series, not always, usually wins the SEC.” But the three-game series over the weekend has added meaning, as both teams will wear yellow uniforms on Saturday to spread awareness for pediatric cancer. Before the game, pitch about two years after losing her 17-year-old daughter and honorary UF teammate, Heather Braswell, to brain cancer. “I think that whenever she steps some memories,” senior Kirsti Merit, to even think about it, but I hope that we can help her get through that day.” Gator softball players from years past will also be in town for alumnae weekend. “This was one of those weekends that we put a star by at the beginning of the school year,” Walton said. “Not trying to have our alumnae more connected to our program.” be where it is today, and some of the ing to Florida without the foundation the alumnae laid. But aside from the events surcus will be on Alabama. The Gators are off to the best start in school history and have the highest winning percentage in the nation by a healthy margin.
