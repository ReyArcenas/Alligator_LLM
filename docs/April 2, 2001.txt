Volume 94 Number 128 www.alligator.org MONDAY, APRIL 2, 2001 Media fights aw limiting photo access By Matthew Boedy Aligator Staff Writer The Orlando Sentinel and its sister newspaper, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, filed a lawsuit in Broward County on Friday to fight the new law banning public access to autopsy photos. The newspapers say the law is poorly defined, violates the First Amendment by limiting the news process, and serves no state interest. To challenge the new law, the newspapers requested autopsy photos of those who died in car crashes, police custody, jails or correctional facilities in 2000. They also asked for autopsy photos for those deaths classified as Jane or John Does in 2000. Sentinel attorney David Bralow said the newspapers chose those photos because of language in the law that allows for access for "good cause," which includes "the public evaluation of government performance." Many media experts have said the new law would limit oversight of medical examiners and correctional facilities, and how they handle bodies. -0 On Wednesday, the newspaper filed a public records request for the photos, which, in the lawsuit, it said it has no intention of publishing. And even see EARNHARDT, page 9 Masters rule Senate able to canvass votes By Joe Black and Sarah Myrick Alligator Staff Writers Well, at least there are no dimpled chads. Like the heavily contested U.S. presidential election that ended just a few months ago, the race for UF student body president has seen recounts, allegations of fraud and appeals to high courts. But a ruling late Sunday night by the Board of Masters, Student Government's version of the Supreme Court, ended Students Unite Now party member's appeals to overthrow the Spring election where Fusion presidential candidate Marc Adler defeated SUN candidate Gil Sanchez by 17 votes. Neither candidate could be reached for comment early Monday morning. The Student Senate now can go forward Tuesday with validating the election, however the Masters mandated the Elections Commission add one more vote to the total cast because a student voted for Anna Shea through a write-in ballot, but not her running mate Gil Sanchez. Had more students taken a similar action, Adler would not have had the majority needed to~avoid a run-off.

Superhero serves sweets, smiles j Cream .... m an By Phillip Crandall Alligator Writer When Clark Kent answered his superhero calling, he left everything he knew of his humble beginnings, driven by his passion for the good and the right to prevail despite the negativity around him. And like the man who became Superman, Ron Fetters has a similar drive. A "I've always been one to like to make people smile," Fetters says. "It is all bout the people and making them smile, no matter what job you do." Simple enough said -but Fetters knows that the best superheroes always let their actions do the talking. Fetters does in fact walk the walk of his heart's desires as...The Ice Cream Man -simultaneously providing beaming kids with frozen goodness and the closest thing to a real-life superhero they might ever know. He doesn't wear a cape or blue tights. Rather, Fetters prefers the reliable comfort :hat-only a pair of Velcro sneakers and dark knee-length shorts can provide. He doesn't have an alter ego, either. Neighborhood kids know him as "Ron," picking him out by the impressive array of 64 unique summer songs that blare from his bluer-than-the-Cookie-Monster ice cream truck. Some area kids even know him as the guy who will get out of the truck to play a pick-up game of basketball. They play by his rules: make a challenging shot, get tree ice cream. Who'd forget you then? One way or another, they know Ron. At 37, he is nothing short of a-celebrity in his Ocala neighborhood. Even when he makes his weekly rounds in Gainesville, kids and adults recognize him, sending waves and shooting smiles his way. Clark Kent Before becoming a street yendor for his own conipany, Starlite Ice Cream, Ron worked a variety of jobs, including civilian deputy, volunteer firefighter and an Orfando ambulance driver. In ambulances, he delivered 360 babies between 1980 and 1992. In 1996, he answered his call to deliver ice cream and started Kid's Dream Ice Cream in Cincinnati, Ohio. While chatting on America Online in October 1997, Fetters came across the picture of a young woman in a "Singles" chat room who lived more than 150 miles from his home. Intrigued by her attitude and motivated by a superhero-sized bit of courage, he asked if they could meet. "She said, 'You'll never find me [in Granville], so why don't we meet at the Dairy Queen?,"' he laughs. This frozen-food fate couldn't have brought Lois and Clark together more fittingly as it did Ron and Belinda Hoffman. Two years after that first DQ date, Hoffman became Belinda Fetters and they began living in see ICE CREAM. page. 3 I 'I MR $:

r-"' AV-r. -j 1f rr -'rm r' Tfiiirnv AIrrr 7 rn~l Education leadersadd-ress funding, SUS reform By, Kristen Mauynski AlligatorWriter" A train is -steamrolling toward Florida's education sysem, and local leaders say K-12, community collegeand university'Jevel educators are-"stickiiig their necks out" in a grassroots effort to try to slow it down. During a press conference of the Florida Faculty Educators Coalition on Friday, education leaders said they were -coming together to address the concerns of education in Florida, namely the reorganization of the state education system and education funding. "If we don't stand up and do the right thing here, no one will do it," Faculty Senate Chairman Joe Layon. said. The group is comprised of representaties of the UF faculty, the Community College Coalition, the Alachua County Education Association, the United Faculty of Florida and Students United to Reform Education. The group said it was not opposed to complete change, just an appropriate change. While the bills the Legislature are considering concerning the reorganization of state education have some Mpotentially positive aspects," the bills -coupled with a decrease in funding -could pose a threat to the quality of education at all levels in Florida, the coalition said. Last week, the House and Senate released drafts of bills that would overhaul Florida's education system into a "seamless" kindergarten through graduate school program. While university leaders have offered their advice-and expertise to the Legislature and members of Gov. Jeb Bush's task force that set out to overhaul education, their suggestions have been ignored. But faculty leaders are not the only ones speaking out about the bills. Last week, UF President Charles Young proposed 12 amendments to the bill, and on March 23, Florida State University President. Sandy D'Alemberte expressed his concern with the bills during a Florida Board of Regents conference call. Coalition leaders said the faculties have more freedom to speak than the 10 state university presidents. Layon said the presidents have to "iake what comes down the pipe" because a president cannot refuse the Legislature and tell it "dare to hit us" with the train. That train, Layon said, could destroy what leaders can administer at UF and other state universities. The coalition said the reorganization's emphasis on centralization of power places too much power in the governor's hands, who would be allowed to hire and fire all members of the Florida Board of Education and the IQ universities' boards of Trustees. The group also aims to advocate for student, faculty and staff input in the shared governance process and on issues of quality assurance and accountability, as well as increased funding at all levels.

MONDAY, APRIL2 Dance Marathon totals increase from last ar By Diana Moskovitz Alligator Writer It was six hours into this year's Dance Marathon, and psychology junior Sergio Rodriguez already felt the pain in his feet as he leaned over one of the long tables on the left wall of the O'Connell Center. Space at thi tables was at a premium, and he had to guard enough space to hold his group's entertainment supplies. "My feet hurt, and I -really don't want to stand anymore," Rodriguez said while glancing up from his book. "Still there's nothing I can do now but tough it out, so I will." But when he saw Kappa Alpha Psi take the stage to perform a step show, Rodriguez forgot his aching feet ano ran to the stage to watch. As the performers began lightly tapping their canes, their routine then building up to a strong rhythm of steps and claps, Rodriguez ignored his pain by jumping up and down, cheering on the performers. This year, Rodriguez was just one of the more than 460 dancers who participated in Dance Marathon, an event during which dancers stay, and stand up for 32 hours to raise money for the Children's Miracle Network at Shands Hospital at UF. However, dancers stayed awake one hour less because of daylight-saving time. Dancers were required to remain standing the entire time, and events were planned throughout the event to keep them motivated. Bands, student groups, performers, video game systems and sports equipment kept the dancers entertained and active. But dancers had to restrict their entertainment to the O'Connell Center floor, which they could not leave until the event ended. Still, dancers remained in contact with the world outside. Cell phones were donated for dancers to make calls, and computers allowed them to send e-mail and chat for limited amounts of time. Almost all of the event's supplies were donated, Chairwoman Leah Donelan said. The majority of the cost of running the marathon is renting the O'Connell Center. At the closing ceremony, Dean of Students Julie Sina was honored for her efforts while at UF in helping Dance Marathon. Delta Tau Delta and Delta Gamma won the Miracle Cup, the award given to the group with the highest combined total of money raised and spirit points. As tired dancers spilled out the O'Connell Center doors, Donelan and the rest of the marathon committee celebrated as the once-packed floor emptied, leaving only empty food wrappers and crumpled ads from sponsors that vied for the dancers' attention. This year's marathon raised more than $178,000, close to $18,000 more than last year, Donelan said. "Every year we have increased the amount raised," Donelan said. "With every marathon we become more successful." Although Dance Marathon is over, preparation for next year's event will begin soon -the committee for it will be formed next week, Donelan said. "The entire event is amazing," Donelan said. "All the families, all the dancers and everyone just comes together for an incredible experience."

If the office thinks the party might ofta Tau Delta fend another group on campus, it will notify the group before the event, she said. "This hasopened our eyes and brought to our recognition a part of the procedure that was not there-before and needs to be there," Cupoli said. Currently, for a party theme to be approved, the idea must pass a social committee and a chapter committee. Then, the Dean of Students Office must approve the party. In response to the party, Asian Student Union and Vietnamese Student Organization received e-mails from the Asian community and Vietnam War veterans. Interfraternity Council President Tim Anderson said'.he would give copies of the e-mails about the incident to all the chapter presidents in the Interfraternity Council. Dean of Multicultural Affairs Corey King said the Dean of Students Office tries to balance the responsibility of monitoring the events without imposing censorship on the events. "In the past, we have been concerned with trying to walk the line between advising our students and censoring them," King said. in the past, we have been more concerned with the safety-of these parties, and now we know we also need to look into other aspects of them." Before this event, steps already began toward increasing diversity awareness in the Greek community. Currently, there is the Chapter Development Program, a program created in which Greek officials provide fraternities and sororities a vision for where the organizations should go. "From the conversations here, it sounds like nothing is being done in the Greek community to increase awareness, and that is not true," Davis said.

Counsel for SUN argued before the Masters on Sunday to have the Senate blocked from validating the votes. SUN counsel argued that because of problems with write-in candidates, multiple voting, machine error, the buying of votes and polling irregularities, there are grounds for the invalidation of the election results and constitute a possible run-off election. "The judiciary has the right to ensure "We are interestei q0he stqzusdiulte~esr~fthe Earnhardt controversy6" &e sad The battle. over access to. Earnhardt's photos includes Campus Communications Inc., the pubfsher of the Alligato arid a Deltona-based Web site. A hearing is set for Thursday before the same judge that barred access to the Earnhardt photos. That case is expected to take on the constitutionality of the new law, said Alligator attorney Thomas Julin. If the Alligator is that the one man, one vote idea is upheld," SUN counsel Jowanna Oates said. "We've had allegations of voting problems and those need to be looked into now before we continue with the process." Oates also argued that the machines used to tabulate the votes could have malfunctioned, and a possible sampling of three districts by hand recount may be necessary to correct the problem -especially with such a close race. "We cannot have blind faith in a machine and [SGJ should be held to same standards [as the state]," she said after citing case law that came from the heavily allow$ access to the Earn jat phlot~ihe questm W iseabe raisedwhether the.neIaw, is retroactive .and whether that retroactiVity and other faults make it unconstitutional, he said.

Brian Koch, counsel for Adler and Maylor, fired back, saying there is no basis for the allegations and the Masters should allow the Senate to.move forward in the canvassing process. "They have yet to provide any evidence of fact for their allegations," Koch said. Koch also argued that no precedent is laid out in UF election code that relates to hand recount sampling of ballots. In its ruling, the Masters upheld the Elections Commission's decision to not call for a recount. "It would bat 1 W. they had 4taen im tissu p4 fixedsoe o h bvio $* lems," she-said.

Mattew Boedy can be reached at mboedy@ailigator.org The appeal to the Masters comes after a Friday night meeting of the Elections Commission, which heard arguments for about fiie hours concerning the election results. SUN officials claimed that a manual recount should be conducted because machine counts cannot be trusted and other election problems could have caused Sanchez and Shea to lose. Commission officials questioned SUN representatives and defended the vote-counting process dutln-the meeting, saying that the machines are more advanced than the ones that caused problems during the 2000 presidential election.

Now that Udonis Haslemand Bett Nelson have decided.to return to UF for another year of collegebsketball, anything less than achieving a Final Fourberth next season would be considered a waste by many Gator fans. Though the Gators lose Major Parker and Brent Wright, they gain at least three McDonald's All-Amneicans and possibly a fourth, according to Coach silly Donovan, who said lhe is looking at both a guard and a forward. Unquestionably, Kwame Brown seemed the most .. ,:r::'%:d The Way it IZ '3 promising prospect at the McDonald's All-American game last week, embodied in a frame that would intimidate many professional ballers. David Lee and James White also looked sharp, adding to the speculation that these three players will have an immediate impact on UF's success or failure next season. Injuries, which plagued UF this season, would have to saturate a large portion of the Gator bench before-Donovan is caught reaching for any Walk-ons next season. For argument's sake, picture Haslem, Nelson, Matt Bonner, Teddy Dupay and Justin Hamilton as the starters. Off the bench or possibly starting would be Brown, Lee or White. Then deep into the bench would be Bonell Colas, Orien Greene and LaDarius Halton. Put simply, UF arguably will have its deepest bench in thehistory of Gator basketball. Next season's lineup has led many to project UF as a top-five team, possibly as high as No. 1. 1 But next season could be the Gators' best chance to win a title for a while. Remember, Brown constantly is courted by NBA scouts. His arrival in Gainesville still is in question, even though Donovan said-he's still coming. But even if Brown does make to UF, he may not stay for long. The possure to make a jump could cause Broiftollow Donnell Harvey, who played just one season before entering the -NBA draft. Then there are H AsleMADupaywho will be seniors. And if Nelson has the type of year he did thjs season, 'he likely would make the jump to the NBA. Even Donovan could go if he wins a national titde, He may feel-his work in Gairnesville is compiled. That could mean either a more prestigious college job or even the NBA. ... Defense dominates in scrimmage B Jeff DadinltO 70Mr Wfev-Ever since Coach Steipurner iolemented his scoring systemin'tohef-p three scrimmages, botk players and coaches said the moQo4Vf spring aternoons in Ben Hill Gdlin stadium'has changed for the betteri.,' There's more desire-they say. More competition. And as ae:sult, more intensity. Saturday, though, the Gators' defense wanted something different -less post-practice spriits. And after defeating the offense 30-1t1, it was rewarded with just that. For the first time thsspring, the offense had to run the IQ0-yard sprints required of the losing a. "We're trying to teach our players how to compete," Spurrier -said. 'When you keep score, there's usually more on the line. Somebody's a winner, somebody's a loser. Right now, it's embarrassing the offensive guys. They'll go in the locker room and the defensive guys will look at them and say, 'We kicked your butts today.'" In its most dominant performance of the spring,-the defense managed chip away at every aspect of the offense's game, finishing with four turnovers and four fumble recoveries. When the offense came as close to the goal line as it would all afternoon, it still could not convert. On three straight attempts from the 1-yard line, running back Willie Green was rejected. On the third attempt, Green fumbled over to the Senior Alex Brown's-two sacks aided the defense to scrimmages against the offense this spring. Ryan Holoway / Alligator Staff its first win in three scored defense. Green, who carried six times for 34 yards in Wednesday's scthm-nage, finished with-six yards on eight carries. Robert Gillespie had 31 yards on six carries. However, despite leadihg the Gators in rushing, he lost'a combined five-? yards on his next five carries after an initial 36-yard run. I "There were some things that all of us did wrong, things we could have done better offensively," Gillespie said. "So as a whole, I don't think we did good. The backs didn't do a lot of things we should have done. The offensive line kind of messed up here and there. But that's the things we come out to practice. At the Orange and Blue Game, we'll be a little better." The defense also held kickers Jeff Chandler and redshirt freshman Brendt Talcott from splitting the uprights on each of their attempts. Chandler missed a 54-yard attempt and Talcott missed a 44-yarder. Alex Brown led the defense with two sacks. "We made plays today," Brown said. "We came out with a little energy, and we made plays." Perhaps the only member of the -offense to gain ground was quarterback Rex Grossman. Grossman -who started the spring slowly -outplayed Brock Berlin, who also is competing for the starting job. Grossman completed 8 of 16 for 168 yards, including a 49-yard pass to Jabar Gaffney on the offense's longest pass of the day. Berlin finished 2 for 7 with 14 yards. Two Gators were injured during Saturday's scrimmage. Rob Roberts suffered a knee injury, which could sideline the senior fullback for the rest of his college career. Tommy Moody fell because of a sprained elbow. Also, defensive end Kennard Ellis wil. miss four to six weeks with a torn ligament in his thumb and Lito Shepparc may sit out today because of a pullet hamstring. jeff Darlington can be reached a, ington@alligator.org It's official: Haslem, Nelson to retum By Izzy Gould Alligator Staff Writer When the NCAA Tournament finals begin tonight, the UF men's basketball team likely will gather around television sets ana watch. Next year the Gators expect to be playing.
