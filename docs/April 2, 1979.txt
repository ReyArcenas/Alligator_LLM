But above all, hustle up ihat vote. Bedsheet banners, multi-colored campaign propaganda and afternoon harangues on the Plaza of the Americas should typify the crucial 10 days before the Student Government primary election April 11. Prohibited from campaigning for the top spots on campus until Friday, five candidates for the 1979-80 student body presidency are expected to begin campaigning in earnest today. Although April 11I ballots for SG elections will include candidates for many SG posts, campaigns for the "Big Three" SG positions of student body president, vice president and treasurer are the ones which student politicos "play for keeps.' Win or lose, thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours traditionally are pumped into each candidate's campaign. The coveted victors largely will determine how some $3 million in student fees -$2.49 a credit hour in taxes -will be spent in the 1980-81 school year. They also os w it h One (f five sttuent b (s preside ttiR itcandliaLites wIII wiit the right to a year if rAesponsibilit\ for S,( school and coiunitv projects, day-to day administration of SG offices and final responsibility for st ident spaditIIitg. The student body vice president, like his national counterpart, is assigned most of his duties by the president. In the past, duties have included supl devising SG projects. The student body treasurer is in charge of SG finances, and his, job requires more day-to-day administrative work than any other SG position. Slates for the three top positions, which were due Friday, show five parties in contention. Several issues were taken up by more than one party. A Halloween Ball in October is promised by three parties -Focus, Impact and Students for Education and Equality. Impact and Focus also promised to reopen the UF Student Credit Union, closed fall quarter for lack of SG effort. S.

alligator, monday, opril 2, 1979, 3 Regents support two state bills affecting Shands By David Futch Alligator Staff Writer Two bills facing thu' Floiridla LA-g Ilatuce'thitwol streamline business operations at Shands Teachiig Hospitil were endorsed by the state Board of Regents at ts Fridas meeting in Pensacola. One bill involves incorporating Shands as a non-profit organization. The second bill authorize" the hospital to issue revenue bonds to build ind improve support services such as prenatal care units antI burn centers. The bond bill designates the state'BoardofuFuicationto appropriate as much as $40 million to improve Shands' support services. The $40 million is toe be repaid ive'r a 30-year period in equivalent annual installments. Board members expect the interest-free bond to be repaid front revenues generated by the hospital. Although the bills call for a group of administrators to oversee policy making, any bylaws created by the new administration would be subject to Regents' approval. "The Board of Regents, through a non-profit organization, would decide what would be best for the teaching hospital and the university," said Steven McArthur, vice chancellor for administration and support. "It is a move to separate the university and the hospital." Regents Chairman James Gardener said the move to a non-profit corporation would better the operation and accountability of the hospital. "They (new administrators) would be more prudent in collection of funds," Gardener said. "They would follow up on collecting bills owed to Shands." McArthur said the hospital wants to become more competitive with other hospitals in wages and support services. "Upon separation of Shands and the university, there will be less red tape involved when administrators attempt to obtain funds or approve wage increases from the state," McArthur said. The contract between the Regents and the non-prof it administration would pinpoint which state dollars would go to what services, according to the administrative guidelines, McArthur said. According to Gardener, the hospital would continue to serve the university in the same capacity as it has in the past; reorganization would be the primary change if the bill passes. e frer Forda's first A crowd of about 500 attended the Saturday. million classroom building. The vet school began dedication of UF's College of Veterinary.Medicine, admitting students in 1976 before completion of the Florida's first vet school. The new facility includes a new facility.

Judge's decision bypasses county, allows city general use of RUB profits By David Futch Alligator Staff Writer Circuit Judge John Crews handcuffed Alachua County commissioners Friday when he restricted the county's authority in profit decisions of the Regional Utilities Board. Crews' decision allows Gainesville to appropriate as much as 50 percent.of RUB profits for city needs regardless of county disapproval. The city uses RUB revenue, which feeds directly into the, general revenue coffers, for projects such as road paving, building maintenance and park be'autification. Crews delivered the blow to county officials in a summarN, judgment Friday, which cami in the aftermath of a Feb. 22 citv-county suit. The county maintains that the 1972 interlocal agreement between the city and county conmmissioners -who all sit on RUB -is ambiguous. A summary judgment pertains to the interpretation of an agreement >f contract, rather than the illegality of a material action. According to the county, the interlocal agreement did not specify the amount of money the city could appropriate from RUB profits. Crews said he ruled in favor of city profit decision-making because Gainesville owns the utilities and is responsible for the debts of the system. In an August meeting, the city requested $3.95 million. while the county said the city should receive only $3.5 million. But the city appropriated $4 million without considering the countv's advice. Disgruntled, the county filed the suit in February to determine its status in the budget-making process of R UB. Another request by the county asked the court to deterniune the county's position as policy makers on RUB, but Crews dismissed the request, allowing the county 10 lays to appeal. On a third count, the county asked the court to determine if a 10-percent surcharge levied on county residents outside the city was fair. Again, Crews ruled in favor of the city when he said, "In 1972 when the city and county agreed on the interlocal contract forming the joint Regional Utilities Board, both parties knew what they were doing." City Attorney J. T. Frankenberger, apparently pleased with the decision, said the prof it decision was the key issue in the suit. "Because the city owns the utilities and is responsible for the debts incurred, count one was the issue most important to us (city)," Frankenburger said. "It means we have control over our money. Gainesville Mayor Bobbie Lisle also smiled her approval at the near total victory. "The city can be pleased with the decisions today," Lisle said. "But even with these decision, there is definite need for HUB." Lisle said that because county and city residents share in the utilities, county'cbmmissioners who sit on the board are an integral 2art in making RUB joint decisions.

In an interview released Sunday by U.S. News aad Warid Report magazine, the first lady said she is used to criticism, but hates it when people question the integrity of her husband or children. As an example, she said, "There's the accuisation that we put funds from the peanut warehouse back in Georgia mio Jimmy's 1976 campaign We were very careful not to do that -and we didn't." She added, "I know that no money went into the ca i paign from the warehouse, so I think it would N-b goodi to get it all cleared up Asked what she thought was behind the many stories on the subject, Mrs Carter replied, iohtiis Just potis I think if Jimmy had not been president, it nerr would havi' happened. -Mrs. Carter said she spent an entire month during the campaign working from 8 a m until I I p m calling people to ask for donations. "We worked so hard for it," she said. "If we could have put the warehouse money in (the campaign), we wouldn't have had to do all that work." She said continuing stories on the peanut warehouse always say "there's nothing to confirm that this ever hap. pened," but at the same time they "plant a little suspicion" Turning to family life at the White House.

Dorm residents to face 5-percent fail rent hike ey henu Thsomm Alligator Staff Writer UF dormitory and Tanglewood Village residents will pay a 5-percent housing increase next fall, the Board of Regents unanimonnly decided Friday at its monthly meeting in Pensacola. The 10-member board that governs the State University System also drew heavy debate from the state's community college representatives when it decided to study further a proposal to designate Florida International University a four-year institution by fall 1980. Currently, four of the nine state universities -FlU, the University of North Florida, the University of West Florida and Florida Atlantic University -are two-year, upper-level universities. The Regents also decided to tackle the year-long problem of funding women intercollegiate athletics at their April meeting in Tallahassee. FlU President Gregory Wolfe requested the study of the state's two-year, upper-level institutions by the Planning and Program Committee during its lengthy meeting Thursday night. But officials from coinmunity colleges fear a new competition for enrollment will hurt their programs, Tallahassee Regent Dubose Auslev said. "Anything you do, you've got to tie in with the community colleges," Ausley said. Community college officials, represented by Miami-Dade Community College President Peter Masiko, attended the Friday's Regents meeting to protest FIU's proposal. Pensacola Regent William Maloy said he is in no hurry to see FlU's estimated SI-million expansion. "There are alternatives to this situation," Maloy said. "Taking away enrollment from community colleges is one issue. Cost is certainly another" "The argument that Miami is the biggest urban center doesn't impress me at all," Maloy said. Regents Chairman James Gardener said the planning committee's study includes the possibility of expanding all four upper-level universities. Gardener added the analysis of the proposal would be in cooperation with the community colleges. Meanwhile, the Regents were satisfied with the Role and Scope plans submitted by the nine universities, although final action on the five-year projections has been delayed until the April meeting. The Regents also will decide on a proposal to request the Florida Legislature to partially fund women's intercollegiate athletics to comply with federal regulations.

S. alligator, monday, opril 2, 1979 editorials/oplinons Bedfellows Another lecture had come to an end and th, members of the graduate English seminar slo lt began filing out of the crowded classroom As in attractive female student got up to lea ti'ith hr classmates, the professor caught her tc iand authoritatit:ely gestured that he' would likc' h'r cto say after class. Several minutes later the prof'ss<>r <id the sti dent were alone. The oung uocan, rtir ccl th professor's intention, gracefully att'mptd t c tricate herself from the acu'k'ard situation, cut could not do so hjcorc tite prof'ssct prop>titi ed: '"Would you like to (ome up to rty ocfit'' this afternoon to discuss your grade and sonic.eoll tice bargaining?" Sex isn't the only thing on professors 11cc1ds these days. The political power of the 1,00 graduate' sti dent assistants throughout the State Universits System recently has aroused the prurient interest of the faculty as it struggles tic force lhe state Legislature t hike salaries and improce'workig condit ionis. Until very recentlythe graduate assistants wre niot considered state employees by the Board of Regents or by the courts. 'Ihey' were cosidcrecd simply students. 'hat classification worked much to the grads' advantage because state cipli eis -such as faculty ierobers are prohibited from striking. Students are not so cost rictedc Because the strike is the most effect ic, if iott the only, weapon employees have against their employers, the unusual situat ion existed whiereb c the graduate assistants had tremendous political power to demand higher wages, while the faculty' had no real power to make like demands. Aware of the students' great power and fearful of the competition they offered for the educational dollar, the faculty union t helinited Faculty of Florida -spent hundreds of dollars seeking to have the cOUrts declare t he students state employees and thus strip the students of ais real bargaining power for better wages. To the grad students' great disadvaitag, T'F was successful. Not satisfied with that victory, UFF now is attempting to gain complete control of and domination over the graduate assistants, apparently to eliminate any opportunity the students hac to compete with the faculty for state' momc. Through the guise of its affiliate 3 hti Graduate Student Unionn -UFF is running a campaign to be elected bargaining agent for the graduate assistants. Obviously more money for graduate assistants will mean less money for faculty members. UFF is not likely to forget this simple fact if it is elected to represent the graduate assistants at the >argaining >oarl. The graduate assistants need their ownt representatives in collective bargaining negotiations. UFF already has proven it is working against the assistants, sot for them. 'lh factilts union has as great an interest in exploiting th l grads as does the Ligislature or the Regents. We hope a new and independent organization of graduate assistants will surface before the expected spring bargaining election. Such an organization can provide tlhe on ly real chane that the students will get a fair dear i bargaining talks. The exploitative advances of UFF must be rejected.

alligator, monday, opril 2, 1979, 9 Ganga money presented problems for Alligator John Ganga meant well. A self-proclaimed pot grower incensed bN ''reefer rustlers" taking over his South America-based crop, the pseudon-ymous John Ganga mailed $I11 cash to The Alligator Jan. 18 in hopes that a group wotild use the nones to sponsor a "smoke-in" protest of pot prohibitions. But Ganga's gisid will brought stick legal and ethical problems for The Alligator -some of which still are naggtug at the paper three months later. Huddled t the cubthole editor's office in the ii-wsrisni the afternoon the Money arrived, the top editors of The Alligator, partic'tlarl myself, failed to anticipate to what lengths the "smoke-itt' ioney eventually would mushroom. We tossed it around as A bright front-page story and printed it just that way the next (lay. The ultimate result was a total fuind of $820 for the benefitt concert in support of iuaijtana retorn'' scheduled from noon to sundown onL lake Alice Field thl% Saturday, sponsored by a Tallahassee-based pot oAobbIsn cooperation with Student Government. Seen Gainesslle groups are to play and a state legislator, a mitarijuana. slobbyist and perhaps a NORMl spokespirstin are expected tos give presentations. The group staging the raills toplse fr i the Rational Reform of Marijuitana IawIs id Iittle Jlistw I(v -specifically does not advocate a ''smiiiiktimi''b f whatever image problems that iould present wxith the Legislature. But a spring afternoon concert in (;aiIInesvIle wit miIiairi sana as its centerpiece surely will offerit a smokein siter other sense of the word. The dilemmas, however, wi-ri s much more complex than that. With those first three tattered $50 bills caime three Iajor problems in The Alligator's decision to publicize the contribution, including: -The journalistically unethical prospect of tying the newspaper too closely to a political event. As the newspaper most concerned with covering student-oriented occurrences. The Alligator had a duty to print the information -in addition to a responsibility to let the public know cash was received But that im essence sanctioned the vent the ionev was for --an illegal gathering of people for the intention of getting high e-.-Lgally, we wondered whether The A114ator ever between the headlines dennis kneale would be charged with conspiraii to commit ri((, ,oi siderig that a smoke-i would constitute illegal activity and that the monec to stage the event came f rot The Alligator And there was the resptnsibilit of the ione being lelt in our hawsks what criteriawoulil we judge the respectiv organizations willing to spotnsor a iarquana protest, And who was The Alligator eilitor to decide i the t irst place'The ethical questions were tt most iipirtant. The Alligator tikis its role as a newspaper serioush and troftessiMials I was ieitor fall nd winter quarters (Ti Siart is sow ii Itor fur spring and summer). and ultimiatels the (;anga was niiine I therefore teared risking The Alligator's reputation and credibiits iterecin support of something which I pirsonallk strongly advocate iiarusiana decrriinmaIt nation. The legal quest ions surroundig our handlingiof the iones were less crucial The Alligator has a history of run-its with the law at one point or another, and through heritage we have learned that to all(iw, the threat of legal activity to pro hibit us from publishing needed information,is to allow an infringement on the First Amendment freedom of the press. The third major quest ion involved the logistics of the whole mess. John Ganga's $150 was followed by $100 from one group, $50 from a woman who no longer smokes marijuaia. as well as additional donations of $ISO and $200 from Ganga. Pot supporters at-large contributed the rest -and all of the cash sat in an Alligator bank account. Six groups contacted Lis about the Great Gainesville Smioke-Iinittibut none had ans spicif ic plans as to what would happen. where it would take place, when or how. We additionallswere concerned with the groups reliability -note had eer b-ffore t ffiscially existed, and the bloes ranged to membership frot Murphree dortn residents and Frisbee freaks to law students and pure ptheads. Enter The People ifor the Rational eform of Marijuana laws etc It's a cumbersimie nai, to Is sure, but the Tallahaissee lobv at least existed long before John Ganga made his first donation in fact, a state legislator has filedton The People's sehalt. a serious bill that woui raise the misdemeanor possession hinit from fiv grams to 28 grants of pit, pusIts sa it stands a bietter-than-even chaltce of advancing further than eser before in the legislative session that begins But tht groip's established status presented another problei-i itters iare so tent on passage of the new bill that the Ii not want t risk Isigu(redibiity with backwotds legislators who woul urimge at the thought of encouraging hundreds to smoke pot i frontof Gi< and everyone. hence, the euphemistic approach a pro-poit -nefit concert, rather thana stmoke-im The mones was dlitated fort a smoke-in -did using the money for ia decriminalizat ion ralls violate the intent of the pubit? And if we decided that it lid,and therefore withheld the monte, a pit protest ( ams sort mav never have happenviIl wiiotild that alst violate the pubic trust placed in The Alligator?

As absurdi as it mac sound, we are presently watching last quarter's Iectures on ta x That's right! There is no teacher! Instead, it's January's information in March. And to make matters worse, have you ever tried to make sense out of a lecture assignment when it is said to be due three months before you entered the course? It's no easy task, I grant Dad ta sIIectures are one thing, but to be forced to learn through stale tapes is quite another. IIIn opinion there is no excuse for such ridiculous and low-quality education practices. As students, we are paying tist miuch mone out in fees to allow ourselves to IstreatedI n such a shiddy manner. Soit' say the business department is analogous to a prostitute: the more you pay, the more oui get screwed. If practices such as thise continue, I would have to be inclined to agree Mark Manuel 3AG

alligator, monday, april 2, 1979, 11 inside A festvalofsunshine By Patrick Connolly Alligator Staff Writer For tall. lean WAltir (',lt Ill (;aimesville's annual Spring Arts IIst i ii was more business than pleasure. While other professional and amtatetir artists set up their displays -which ranged from I'm a gnome, take me home' woodcut figures to photographs of car bumper'. and etched stained glass mirrors Cade just sat back quietly in the sunshine and watched. His attention was centered on two works with $969 price tags. They were his creations, and he was confident they would sell. Art is Cade's life. He spends four months in the winter warmth of Miami every year (the other eight in New York City) and travels to art shows around the state. And apparentl,, he is successful. Cade said his income last sear was onethird as much as the ex-governor of New York. That ex-governor was also an ex-vice president at the time of his death earlier this Year, so tall, lean Walter Cade III is sucessfu. His works of art are collages, huge collages of emotion and feeling, backgrounded by New York garment buildings with the win dows cut out, each window exposing some part of what Walter Cade ItI I-alls fife. fie calls life happy. Butterflies float tip out of garbage cans, baboons cuddle toddlers, the sun shines a bright orange, the zebra peers out while the rhinoceros bellows and the cars roar down the road and an old couple embrace and the coke machine looks broken and the wash is on the line. .. "I grew up in New York, but I was never poor. We always had ehough to eat, goodf clothes to wear and all that, so I'm rot showing a downtrodden, nasty life in these tenements," Cade said. "I feel a kindred feeling with the people in the tenement when I walk through them. I feel a warm feeling -but I wouldn't want to live there -and for that feeling to come out it has to be in my 'vork as an artist, it) my collages." While Cade sat, watched and waited, the product of Peter Cooney's art wafted gently through the stately trees of Northeast First Street, providing a pleasing musical backdrop. Cooney was giving a demonstration on the dulcimer. With his German shepherd, Blue, panting at his time keepin' feet, Cittiney strummed on hn original Amerir.,n instru' ment developed in Appalachia .Made of a conglomeration of different woods, the dulcimer sounds somewhat like a bagpipe via four strings. "I'm my own boss," the bespectacled Cooney said of his handcrafted dulcimers and his travels from his Off the Wall instrument shop in Bfioimington, Ind. "It's not much of a living, but I get by," lie continued. "I was the youngest in a famil\ of gifted musicians, and instead of trying to play one instrument extremely well, I de< ided to make a variety of instruments. "I've gotten my wood from all over. I -is working on a church pipe organ one ti a'. They were tearing down spruce wall sidiivLs. I asked for 'em and got 'em," he said. lIidiana uses a lot of cedar fenceposts, so I ft a bunch of them too." hangit ig i irieI frot $ ('51 ( $2; i) ( ii1% siid he i-alt mak fit itidi d, iirs m Ii h) 20 hotirs if s-Iirk It tatko-sJ( x,( 'ic I r lmivcr mu1ch l1n1g4 r tocomit b just one gid pief fits art Cuellar is a photographer, At ltinderwater photographer to be exact i t-speciat/s it pabientl captitritig t'he c farmiti i tt endangered manatee, a sluiw-rniis ing,. gentle, rigetarian inanimal Out 'if around 5f photographs.

____________________________________________________alligator, monday, april 2, 1979, 15 Watkins, Gators sweep Tennessee series By Ralph Diaz Alligator Staff Writer UF centerfielder Jim Watkins probabis wishes the Gators could play the Universits of Tennessee baseball team more than six times this season. The Volunteer pitching staff has seen i-nough of Watkins in three games to wish otherwise. Watkins' solo home run Sundas ii the bottom of the seventh inning put the Ca-tors ahead 2-1. Kerry Kellogg stifled Tennessee the final two innings as UF swept the weekend series 'Ihe Gators won both games of a Isuibleheader Saturday bv 6-0 and 13-1 scores. The three victories upped lt'[s Southeastern Conference Eastern Divisi" o lirst-place mark to 8-1 andtheoverall record to 23-6. In addition, the Gators no\,has v won 15 of their last 16 games. Watkins' two hits Sunday gave ohiiseen Sor the series. His homer was his third( ol the sea r. 'I think I've had my season's slinmp,'' Watkins said. "I'm being more sslective at the plate now. I'm also doing something now" I wasn't doing earlier. I'm getting on base I feel I'm helping the team out ore.' In the third inning Watkins singled with two out. Tennessee pitcher Gary Rivers Isis just picked Steve Minicone off first base 'ind aine close to nabbing Watkins. ".1 know I picked him off hss rs sais le (Watkins) knows it too." Watkins stole second'base and scored the first run of the garge when UF shortstop I arry Hall doubled down the left-fieldl hne. Tennessee tied the game in the top of the seventh inning when Volunteer designated hitter Barry Wright singled to l jt and alti isanced to third on David Banes' -rrr i tirigit t hen s (re sit a satril Is-fls ihe \tluntet-rs scslected ssien lits tff Ktlliigy pgtaiSsKl'' got it a 'fesw lams but was never nIIIs sIrious trouble.

The game may hinv been played on "Doug'sRug" but all the shouts and bangs were for Pell. A record crowd of 23,150 came to see the Blue squad defeat, or rather, "Pelletize", the Orange, 2 1-0. Although the scrimmage competed with a UF baseball double-header and a carnival across the street, football crazy fans witnessed Pell's debut on Florida Field -no matter that Pell sat in the press box the entire game. The two offensive squads managed to produce three plays worthy of watching on instant-replay. Orange running back Calvin Davis, who led all runners with 67 yards on 20 carried, streaked for 20 yards before Vernon James made a touchdown-saving tackle. ( )rang quarterback sLarr Ochab, who us it fist (, )B if It iingIt -ith i six for srsri ri HMd 74 ard passing game, completed 11 17 sard tois tn Johin (affne'. \id Blue quarterback Jim McClellan, <iriit-ur if wIs ii s t i nnirg drives, thr-sw a -5siid touchdown pass to Darrell Jones with S 10 eft in it third quarter. The other Blue toUchdwriss iwer scored un a two-ard touchdown n plunge by tailback Shannon Burch and a 70-yard interception return b -icorierback Chuck Lynch. Altiiugh few players besides McClellan, Ochua. Davis and defensive players Scot Brantley and Mike Ricketts looked impressive, some, like Orange quarterback Tyrone Young, struggled. Young started for the Orange and wound up completing just three of II attempts for 44 yards and three interceptions. Young was bothered by bursitis in the throwing arm elbow. "I was definitely disappointed," Young said. "I looked at the game as a fun game but then again I took it serious. I made myself think I'm lining up against (the University of) Houston. It's a motivation type thing." Houston tore up Young Saturday night. But for Young and his UF teammates, fall practice lies ahead before the imaginary Houston game turns into a mason-opening realIty. 1. alligator, monday, april 2, 1979 weekend replay UF track team places winners in Relays finals AFR
